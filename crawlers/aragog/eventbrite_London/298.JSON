    "desc": "Date:  Monday, 23 November Time:  6.00-8.00 pm Location:  Pyramid Room, Strand Campus, King's College London    From the Gulf to Ararat:  Imperial Boundary Making in the Late Ottoman Empire ***** ?In the autumn of 1914, a few weeks after the outbreak of the War, a small party consisting of Englishmen, Russians, Turks and Persians, arrived on a snow-clad spur of Mount Ararat, constructed an unobtrusive stone pillar beneath the shadow of the great 17,000-foot peak, and swiftly dispersed, each to his own country? ? Thus begins one of the most compelling accounts of imperial boundary making ever published. Its author ? G.E. Hubbard ? was secretary to the British delegation of the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission that was charged with finalising the Perso-Ottoman boundary on the ground. A key member of the Commission, his acute observation, intelligence and ever present sense of humour offer a narrative that is frequently amusing, always informative and speaks to the contemporary world with a relevance that belies the century that has passed since its first publication. ? This new edition incorporates many new photographs from G.E. Hubbard?s original photographic album of the Commission, a new introduction by his granddaughter Sue Littledale, based on personal letters and material from the family archive; and a foreword by Richard Schofield of King?s College London, a leading international authority on territorial questions of the Middle East."
