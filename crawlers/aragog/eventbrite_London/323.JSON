This time it will be Christmas themed, by which we mean that there will be mince pies, Christmas themed team names, and active encouragement of awful Christmas jumpers. We want bobbles, people. It's bring your own drink, but we can provide cups, some nibbles, and lots of Christmas cheer. There will be spot prizes throughout the night, and a ?10 book token for every member of the winning team (remember, max 4 per team!)"
