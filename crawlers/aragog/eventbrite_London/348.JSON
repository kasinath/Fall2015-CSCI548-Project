    "desc": "(Eleanor Rathbone Chair of Sociology, University of Liverpool, UK) : Bare your body, bare your soul? The historical traces of war?s violence(s) on violence against women : In this presentation I want to discuss a photograph. It is a picture that featured on the front page of La Provence in Avignon in the summer of 2014 on the day the city marked the 70 ?anniversary of its liberation. The woman, a ?collabos?, is being escorted by men, naked, through the streets of Avignon past male onlookers to the Palace de Papes, where her head is to be shaved. I want to use this photograph as a device for exploring the connections between the violence of war and the ongoing intransigence of violence against women that appears to transcend cultural borders. (I use this photograph with the permission of the Archives de la ville d?Avignon 49Fi212, Phot. DR. It is unknown who took the original but it was taken on 25 ?August 1944.)"
