Pongathon ?have joined forces to organise a battle to top all battles. It will be a super exciting night, as 16 tech start-ups put their 4 best players forward, but only one will be crowned the ping pong champion of London. Ping pong addicts of any ability will also be able to join in at the social ping pong tables on this year?s event. We will have skilled players giving master classes, challenges and competitions around the venue."
