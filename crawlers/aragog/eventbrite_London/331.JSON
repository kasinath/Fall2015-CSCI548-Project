For one spectacular evening we have brought together an inspiring collection of independent craft makers to present, showcase and sell to you their own examples of exceptional craftsmanship. With returning presenters such as Oppermann London, Masel Ties and welcoming brands like Sally Lees Contemporary Jewellery and with Christmas soon upon us this will be the perfect opportunity to source pieces that can also be enjoyed, shared and gifted during the this wonderful time of the year. For those who missed our last gentleman's retail showroom, this will be an excellent chance to ?be part of an experience which passionately supports craftsmanship, traditionalism and individualism ?for the modern gentleman.? To miss out again would be outrageous"
