Start off your evening with complimentary mulled wine and mince pies, and absorb the lively Christmas feeling with our celebrity readers and performances from three fantastic choirs. This year, our choirs will be taking us through a mix of traditional and modern carols. We are delighted to welcome back the Tiffinians and Voce Chamber Choir, directed by Suzi Digby OBE. An exciting new addition to this year?s event will be Black Voices, a female gospel choir led by Carol Pemberton MBE, who will be guiding the audience through some fabulous gospel pieces. Dame Diana Rigg DBE, Larry Lamb (Gavin and Stacey, Eastenders), Mark Lawrenson (football?veteran and broadcaster)?and Patrick Robinson (Casualty) will be performing festive readings at this year's event. It?s a perfect night out for family and friends to get together to celebrate the season as well as to remember loved ones who are no longer with us. This incredibly popular evening has sold out for the past 3 years to book early to avoid disappointment."
