    "desc": "Within Translation Studies Roman Jakobson is probably best known for a 1959 article, ?On Linguistic Aspects of Translation?. Yet it is not this little article that is of most interest to our discipline. Of much greater interest is the broader range of Jakobson?s thinking, and his insights into the language of literature and into the interplay of universality and particularity in languages, seen within the cultural and intellectual context in which these ideas developed. In this talk I will consider a few of his key ideas and suggest what they might mean for the way we think about translation today, as well as for the way we translate."
