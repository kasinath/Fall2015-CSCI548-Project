The serious consequences of software faults are regularly reported in press headlines. The cost to companies of finding and fixing faults is very high. Tracy will talk about her work on developing effective approaches to finding software faults and to understanding the different types of faults that software commonly contains. She will also discuss her emerging work on techniques to analyse the human origin of faults and on tools to help the developer prevent faults. ?? Brunel?s Inaugural Lectures are a free series of exciting events that showcase the fascinating range of research being carried out at Brunel University London. All lectures are for anyone with an interest in the specialist field/topic and we welcome you to come and join us."
