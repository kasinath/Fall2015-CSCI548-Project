    "desc": "The regeneration of London Docklands is perhaps one of the largest Regeneration projects in Europe. , it is associated both with success in terms of physical transformation and failure in terms of transforming the lives of existing residents. It is simultaneously a model for both how and how not to do development. Thirty years on it is interesting to revisit this project to evaluate the approach applied and lessons learned. What was the impact of over-riding local forms of governance and accountability and establishing a single regeneration agency? Why have unemployment levels remained persistently high? Was this really a market led approach to regeneration? What has been the impact on housing and housing need? Whilst critiquing the approach applied at London Docklands how different is this from contemporary approaches to regeneration? What are the alternatives?"
