    "desc": "Simon Schama speaks about his acclaimed television series, book and National Portrait Gallery exhibition  The Face of Britain: The Nation through its Portraits,  which, mesmerising in breath and panache, change forever the way we see our past and ourselves. In the age of the hasty glance and the selfie, Simon Schama?s  The Face of Britain  is a tour de force about the long exchange of looks from which British portraits have been made over the centuries: images of the modest and the mighty, of friends and lovers, heroes and working people. Each of them - the image-maker, the subject, and the rest of us who get to look at them - are brought unforgettably to life. Together they build into a collective picture of Britain, our past and our present, a look into the mirror of our identity at a moment when we are wondering just who we are. Combining his two great passions, British history and art history, Schama?s extraordinary storytelling reveals the truth behind the nation's most famous portrayals of power, love, fame, the self, and the people. This ticket is also valid for free entry to the 'Works on Paper Fair' before or after the talk. Cash bar available."
