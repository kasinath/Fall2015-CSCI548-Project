    "desc": "SEMINAR SERIES AT THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Dr Simon Underdown, Oxford Brookes University Wednesday 16 December at 5.30 pm The cabin and conversations shared by a young Charles Darwin and Captain Robert Ftizroy onboard the HMS Beagle produced one of the most well known episodes in the history of science. Perhaps what is less well known is how the two families were already linked through politics, poetry and prosecutions. Darwin retired from public life and developed his theory while Fitzroy threw his life and own money into public service. The festive season is a fitting time to explore how the interlinked lives of four men produced a Dickensian plot that still influences so many aspects of the anthropology we know today."
