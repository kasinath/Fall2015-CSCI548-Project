So we thought we would put the two together and create the ultimate boat party. ? Sooo?Grab your Santa Suit and come celebrate the festive season with hundreds of fellow Santa's on the river Thames. ?We will be substituting the dull milk and cookies for a day filled with naughtiness and jolly god damn fun!! Our boat party will give you the opportunity to party with fellow Church goers while taking in the amazing sights of London that can only be seen on the Thames. An adventure not to be missed!!? ? The boat will leave from Tower Millennium Pier at 12pm sharp on 13  December 2015. ? ** Our Church boat parties sell out every year so get in quick to avoid disappointment."
