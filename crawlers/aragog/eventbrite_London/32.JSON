It was a token of gratitude for Davy?s invention of the miners? safety lamp ten years before. With appropriately explosive demonstrations,  Frank James  will showcase Davy?s experimental development of his lamp while reflecting on the relationship between science and the state symbolised by the Davy cup, one of treasures from the Royal Institution?s museum collections. Free tickets are available to Members of the Ri.  Find out more about how to join ."
