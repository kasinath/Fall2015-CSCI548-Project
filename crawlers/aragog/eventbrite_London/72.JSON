This is a family pantomime with colourful sets and lots of audience participation. The setting and relaxed atmosphere is ideal for smaller children. As well as Dick himself, meet his feline friend Tommy, his nasty enemy Captain Hawkseye and some evil pirates. N.B. Children must be accompanied by an adult"
