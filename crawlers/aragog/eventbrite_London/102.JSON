The talk will also offer a rare opportunity to go ?behind the scenes? on the making of BBC Earth?s 3D theatrical film  Enchanted Kingdom  - a spell -binding and immersive journey through Africa, ?transporting you from grey urbanity through seven distinct realms in the wildest continent on Earth.? ? Water has had a huge impact on many of Patrick and Huw?s film making experiences, so all proceeds of ticket sales will be donated to international water aid charity, Just a Drop. ? Following the talk, a Q&A session will take place between both directors which will be chaired by BBC HARDtalk presenter and Just a Drop patron, Stephen Sackur. There will also be a charity raffle where a few lucky winners will be able to win some prizes."
