    "desc": "Join us for an incredibly special night as Chris T-T marks the ten-year anniversary of his fantastic album 9 Red Songs. We?ll be gathering at Red Hedgehog, an unusual and very intimate seated venue, where Chris will perform the album in full, on guitar and piano, armed with some of his finest work. Described by Tom Robinson as ?rough, ready and compelling? and The Guardian as ?genius songwriting?, 9 Red Songs was Chris?s fifth album and marked a sharp change of direction from the psych pop and sarcasm of his earlier records. 9 Red Songs hails from the time ?when Blair was in No. 10, British troops were in Iraq and Myspace was the big new thing. A moving, mischevious meditation on all that is shit, that really has stood the test of time.? We?ve chosen a small place with just a hundred seats, so advance booking is definitely recommended. For now the first 30 early bird tickets are available at a reduced price of ?10 so get booking. Tickets are available at?. This particular show will be very much a one-off so don?t miss out."
