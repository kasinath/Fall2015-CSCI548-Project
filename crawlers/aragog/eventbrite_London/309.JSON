    "desc": "The Super Rapidplay is a 10-round FIDE-rated open tournament with no grading sections; instead all players play in the same section and generous grading prizes have been added. Pairings:  Pairings for all rounds will be made according to FIDE swiss pairing rules.  Time Control:  All moves in 25 minutes plus a 10 second increment per move from move 1. Default time: 10 minutes after scheduled start time.  All participants except ECF Silver and Gold Members must pay the ECF (English Chess Federation) ?7 Pay2Play fee. Grades:  Rapidplay ECF grades published in the August 2015 list will be used for this event. For players without a current ECF Rapidplay grade, the following grades / ratings will be used instead: (1) ECF standard play, (2) FIDE rapid, (3) FIDE standard, (4) Other national rating. Byes:  Up to two half-point byes can be taken between rounds 1-9 provided they are requested before the end of the previous round."
