His acclaimed book? ?takes a scientist?s reading of the Old Testament?s Book of Job and uses this ancient text as a centrepiece to make the case for science as a deeply human and ancient activity. Drawing on stories from the modern science of chaos and uncertainty, alongside medieval, patristic, classical and Biblical sources, Tom challenges much of the current ?science and religion? debate as operating with the wrong assumptions and in the wrong space. Join Tom at Theos to explore the true relationship of ?science? and ?faith?."
