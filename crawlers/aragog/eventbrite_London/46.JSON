We will be joined by Classic FM presenter Nicholas Owen and actresses Alison Steadman and Anita Dobson, who will present festive readings alongside a programme of Christmassy choral music sung by the Temple Singers, and traditional carols for you to join in.? The concert is also chance to remember our loved ones through placing star tributes on our Christmas tree which will be available to personalise on arrival at the concert. ? The Temple Church is one of the most unique and beautiful churches in London. The Church was built by the Knights Templar, the order of crusading monks founded to protect pilgrims on their way to and from Jerusalem in the 12th century. The Temple Church lies ?off street? between Fleet Street and the River Thames, in an ?oasis? of ancient buildings, courtyards and gardens and is wonderfully atmospheric at Christmas. ? Tickets include entry to the concert, a glass of something festive and a mince pie.? All funds raised from ticket sales will go towards our lifesaving research and information and support services.? We hope you can join us at this first and very special Pancreatic Cancer UK Christmas celebration."
