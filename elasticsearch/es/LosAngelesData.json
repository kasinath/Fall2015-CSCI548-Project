Had to go back to the towers to contemplate some more and see the details I had missed before."},{"review":"Visiting for USC Parents Weekend, we left the campus to tour Watts Towers! What a treat!\nOur tour guide, James, was passionate and informative!\nThe structure itself was fascinating! I have wanted to visit this structure since I was in college and I am so glad that we ventured there.\nThe area was safe, parking was easy, and the video was saw before was great!\nIf you are a lover of folk art, community art, or appreciate history, I highly recommend going!\n\n"},{"review":"I have always loved the Towers. They are pure grass roots art and offer a spiritual feel all that is Los Angeles. SEE THEM."},{"review":"Still an amazing piece of history. Ensure that you are aware of your surroundings as you tour. Watts is a tough area of L.A.."},{"review":"Let me start with, as I usually do, talking about the people who rated this one star. Those who took public transportation... Did not do their research! This is south central. Basically anybody who lives in America knows Compton is basically the worst area along with harlem. Well this is almost right next to Compton. If you did not take a tour or your own car- you have a low chance of having a good experience. There are lots of gangs so be smart. If you take a tour or car you will be fine- once you are there you are safe. This is a tourist attraction so there are guides and police so it's not just you and a couple of thugs. Also- I would rate this 5 but considering how many fun things there are in LA don't bother wasting a whole precious day on this unless you have many open days or do many things in one day. If you are staying in a nice area like hollywood or Beverly Hills, this is very far- the other side of town. So again do your research, be smart, stay safe, this will be fun. Sure the building isn't that amazing compared to that church in barca that other review said this is a bad version of, was made by hundreds of people, this was made by a local out of kindness by himself. It is made of TRASH! It's pretty cool."},{"review":"This outstanding folk art is a MUST SEE for all to visit. His dedication, craftsmanship and talent is an inspiration. It is just a short walk from the blue line transit stop."},{"review":"The Towers are amazing to see. The problem is that they are located in a very HIGH CRIME area of South Los Angeles."},{"review":"You have to go and see the towers at least once in your lifetime! The story behind the towers was very interesting, the tour guide was very knowledgeable and answered everyone's questions professionally. There was a nominal fee to go inside the gated area of the towers, and a small museum of artists from the area. There was even a 15 minute video about the creator of the towers which helped you to understand the man behind the towers. Sadly though, the neighborhood surrounding the towers could really use a large trash can, a strong back, a good broom and rake, to bring the neighborhood back to it's once vibrant beauty."},{"review":"My only free day in the area was unfortunately on a Tuesday, when it's closed. You can still see the towers from outside the fence, but no tours that walk you through the structures.\n\nSimon Rodia's towers are like an antidote to stereotypical LA. It's in a not-so-great neighborhood whose other claim to fame is the riots of 1965 and has been beset by socioeconomic troubles since then. In contrast to the money and glitz just miles away in Hollywood, Rodia's \"Nuestro Pueblo,\" as he called them, was made by one guy over 33 years using scrap rebar, found objects, and a homemade concrete mixture. It's a testament to the imagination, dedication, and creative vision of an ordinary guy achieving extraordinary things against all naysayers, city bureaucracy and regulation, and unhappy neighbors."},{"review":"Some describe the Watts Towers as the largest single piece of folk art in the world. The nearby museum and the guides will fill you in on the story of the man who built them. The towers have to be seen to be understood. Decorated with broken crockery and tile, these structures have a unique beauty and lightness. A must see!"}],"streetAddress":"1765 East 107th St","name":"Watts Towers","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" 213 847 4646","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

I would walk around this park several times a day just to get fresh air. Several times we actually saw commercials being filmed and galas happening at this park..Its sort of a happening place!"},{"review":"This is a great little park in downtown Los Angeles bordered by grand and hope. We discovered it while searching for an apartment building we might be interested, If you are in the neighborhood and need a a place to sit down and enjoy a cup of coffee away from the city for a few minutes this is for you. It has water features, a kids playground and workout equipment. It feels safe and for whatever reason, the homeless have not taken it over. This is not an LA destination, but rather a wonderful amenity of a fast growing neighborhood of new and rehabbed apartments, condominiums and lofts."},{"review":"I've brought my kids here several times just to ooh and ahh at the color changing fountain. I think this experience is best at dusk so the kids really appreciate the color glow before them. Water embraces the floor in front of the fountain for a good 50 feet or so and kids love playing and splashing in it. There is a Starbucks conveniently located here too for the big kids. The park has a nice view of City Hall and the landscape is sort of desert like but peaceful. There isn't a whole lot here but kids will appreciate the effort just to partake in the fun of the fountain. Best part, it's free."},{"review":"It is a nice relaxing park located in Downtown LA. Just a couple of blocks away from Staples Center. We didn't plan for the visit. It was a coincidence discover this park when we visit FIDM-LA Campus. i would said it was a surprise of my trip. Actually we went there twice, one in day, one at night. In the day, you would enjoy the sunshine in the park and have a good breathing within those lush trees and lawn. Also the fountain is another attraction in the park. Especially at night, you will see the color changing underneath the water. You will feel the relaxing and calm while you stay in the park anytime. I Love this place a lot.!!"},{"review":"This is a recent addition to downtown LA, and it is long overdue. In a city notorious for charging for everything (pay toilets?!), this place is an oasis. There are many roaring fountains sloped down a park that stretches from Grand to Main St. There are plenty of chairs, and security keeps the area safe. The trees and grass are well kept, and occasionally there is a music show down here. It's a great place to run through, or just take your coffee and read a paper."},{"review":"Nao acho que deva perder tempo bisitando ,so como eu que gosto de cainhat e estava por perto dei uma passada,euma paca como outras quqlquer nada especial"}],"streetAddress":"Between 9th St, Olympic Ave, Grand Ave and South Hope St","postalCode":"90017","name":"Grand Hope Park","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" +1 213 624 0555","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

A beautiful campus....you could spend hours just gazing at the amazing architecture."},{"review":"A very beautiful campus and very close to expensive houses. The best school in this area and very competitive to get in."},{"review":"Arrived as a foreign delegate for conference. Finding the Courtside Collection is tricky for taxi drivers - it is not signposted inside the parking garage, so the driver didn't know where to drop me off. Neither did the parking attendants. Reception staff are students who aren't always knowledgeable or service trained. Four fab exceptions..Jenelle. Theodore and two Hispanic chaps. I wasn't offered help with a massive suitcase. I had to ask and was questioned why I brought such a huge suitcase. Way to welcome a guest! No one on reception knew where to hail buses from either. Pathetic.. My phone charger broke and no one had spare international\/USB adapters on reception\/knew where to buy one. One chap let me borrow his. We figured out chargers could be bought metres away at the university shop. Three days later. I don't understand whether the staff know how to look after a conference guest at all. I missed breakfast the first day as it finished v.early on a Sunday. Who seriously eats breakfast 7-9am on a weekend? Having said that, the breakfast was exceptional. For kings and queens. So much choice and v.tasty too :) The tech centre is full of protocol driven nobodies who won't let guests use chairs, even if their work takes longer than a few minutes. I had to beg their manager to use a chair. He let me. The campus is poorly lit and hard to find in the dark. If you get lost, go to Ucla medical centre and they will drive you home. All in all a bad stay, somewhat mitigated by a lovely room with lots of TV channels."},{"review":"I visited with a group of teenagers.

The barn is chocked full of memorabilia and silent short films from the birth of Hollywood. \n\nThe museum is at the foot of the Hollywood Hills near the Hollywood Bowl and Griffith Park surrounded by avocado trees. It's easy to miss since the small building it is set back in one of the Hollywood Bowl parking lots. \n\nThe museum is closed now for renovation. When it reopens don't miss the chance to immerse yourself in Hollywood history."},{"review":"If you've ever wanted to see items from Charlie Chaplin's movie studio, Cecil B DeMille's The Ten Commandments, props, costumes and other artifacts from Hollywood's Golden era, this is the place. The museum building is actually the first home of what would be later called Paramount Studios. The Barn was the home base for Hollywood's first feature length motion picture and it has a rich history all its own,\n\nThis is a must see for any classic film fan. It's so inexpensive to enter and all the proceeds benefit the Museum. Becoming a member is so easy and costs so little. You must see the building that would become the Paramount Studio Gym. Its restoration is an amazing story in itself. Located across the street from the Hollywood Bowl, this attraction is never too crowded and has a charming gift shop with some rare and wonderful items.\n\nDon't miss this treasure."},{"review":"This is a great antidote to the circus that is Hollywood and Highland. It is small, and very interesting, in the original barn (which has moved three times) that the first studio was set up in by Cecil B de Mille. \n\nThe docents and volunteers were very informative and there is a small but good book shop. \n\nPlans are underway to recreate an outdoor sound stage. That will add even more to the experience."},{"review":"A wonderful little museum dedicated to the birth of \"Hollywood.\" I always say that you have to know where you came from to truly appreciate where you are, and if you are a movie fan of any caliber this is a \"must see.\" Cecil B. DeMille's office!! You can feel the energy! This is an all volunteer run museum, and these folks really know their film\/Hollywood history! They have limited hours so check the website before venturing out. Well worth the reasonable $7 admission fee."},{"review":"This little museum is a little off the main tourist path but well worth a visit. Limited hours so check the website before you go. Building was Cecil B. DeMille's original office from the time he made his first Hollywood movie until he died soon after finishing \"The Ten Commandments\" 40+ years later. Some of the exhibits are permanent, so come and go. The day we visited was just after a temporary exhibit had left so a little empty.\n\nThe real gem is the docent who was willing to talk for hours explaining the history of movie making in Hollywood. Using a few old photos for visual clues, he made history come alive. It was a joy talking with him and asking a few questions to keep the information coming. A real treat to find someone who loves what they do and is willing to share their knowledge with anyone who asks.\n\nThe $7 admission fee is about right given the limited exhibition space. Parking is free, book store is small, didn't see anything unusual or rare to buy. A fifteen minute walk (up hill) on Highland Ave. from the corner of Hollywood & Highland and the Dolby Theater\/Chinese Theater complex. Across the street from the Hollywood Bowl which also has a small museum. Worth the hike."},{"review":"I did not expect much as it is a small barn like structure on the side of the road.

Demille's first office, great exhibits, videos of vintage Hollywood, artifacts from the silent era, knowledgeable staff, great display on Julia Adams presently on display, wonderful videos, free parking, modest entry fee."},{"review":"It's where 'Hollywood' as we know it began. By walking into the Hollywood Heritage Museum, your walking directly into the original office and studio of Cecil B. Demille, one of Hollywood's film pioneers. Wonderful exhibits, oversized photos, vintage ephemera, film props, camera's, projectors all from the silent era. They have videos, and much to see, explore and learn. Also a wonderful book and gift shop. Highly recommended. Just a 10 minute stroll up the street from the more famous Chinese Theater and across the street from the Hollywood Bowl, which also has a great little museum."},{"review":"If you\u2019re interested in the history of Hollywood film-making from its earliest days, this very interesting little museum is a must-see! Don't let the simplistic exterior fool you: this museum manages to pack a lot of great material into a small space. It\u2019s a fairly easy walk from Hollywood Blvd. or the Hollywood & Highland parking garage (but also has its own free parking lot). The structure is the actual barn used by Cecil B. DeMille and co. as the \"studio\" for Hollywood's first feature film, \"The Squaw Man\" (1914). DeMille's office is recreated as it appeared back then, and the remaining permanent exhibits include a variety of rare and fascinating items (particularly noteworthy are the various silent-era movie cameras), even a Rudolph Valentino tribute area. As of this writing (June 2012), an additional wealth of historical memorabilia is on loan from Paramount Studios to commemorate that studio's centennial (DeMille, Jesse Lasky, and Sam Goldwyn later merged their Lasky Film Co. with Paramount). The entry rates are very reasonable, the hours have been extended beyond the previous weekends-only, and the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. There is also a good book\/gift shop that contains excellent merchandise. Very much enjoyed the Hollywood Heritage Museum, and will stop by again the next time I\u2019m in town!"},{"review":"The Museum just reopened. This is the building where Cecil B. DeMille made his first movie in Hollywood. The building has been moved from its original location and has been restored. It contains his office with some of his furniture and shoes.

As I walked into the theater with my mom and younger cousin we were in awe of the beauty of the theater. The ceilings were beautiful and lighting was terrific. However, the seats were a little to tight for fitting. As the performance was fantastic, couldn't help but to worry about the guys and hoping they wouldn't run into each other on the stage. Very tight fit for them.

You wouldn't expect how ornate and fancy it is inside by the look of it on the outside. \n\nWe lived almost across the street from the Orpheum for a year and it was so great that we were able to see a couple shows there. There's nothing like walking to a show, getting dinner afterwards next door at Umami and getting home in 2 minutes."},{"review":"My first venture into LA was to this historic theater to watch my favorite band perform an evening with Dream Theater, and I was not disappointed at all. While I know not much of the history of this location I honestly spent the time of the opening doors to the beginning of the show exploring the details of the theater. While we sat on the last aisle on the floor seating, the sight to the stage was great and not bad for a short guy like me. The theater's acoustics in my opinion was exceptional, the lighting was soft and mellow for a rock concert. The styling of the theater feels like a flash to the past and I was walking around mesmerized by the decor and style of the theater. I hope to have another chance to visit this theater for another show of some sort in the near future. Thank you"},{"review":"The theater is beautiful, you can\u2019t get a bad seat, and the sound is excellent the only down side is they only take cash!

This Audubon center has kids making field trips here as well as parental trips on the weekends. I instantly knew when I realized what was happening here, that the munchkin would love to stop by.\n\nThis Center is a great starting\/stopping point if you want to hike through Earnest E Debs Regional Park. It sits on the southwestern edge and has a parking lot with a roundabout. The parking spaces are over dirt with a paved road. They have public restrooms that the hikers can easily access as well as visitors to the center. Best of all, this place is FREE to visit and get a nature lesson for your tots. Or at least an opportunity to interact with something tangible in lieu of electronics or iThings. That alone is priceless!\n\nPro Tip: You can host a kids birthday or other party here for a slightly different outlook on birthdays =)\n\nThey have a short children's nature walk, multiple interactive features made for munchkins, a kids clubhouse, picnic tables, a classroom\/small auditorium for lessons or speakers. There is also an information room with an attendant on duty willing to share different aspects of the park, Audubon center, native flora n fauna, animals, or stuff like that. Another fun feature at the entrance and on the edge of the roundabout is a koi pond... but they don't have koi fish in it that I saw, however it had some guppies and a few lily pads.\n\nOverall though this place seemed very kewl for the little ones. While I was in the information room, a little boy and his dad stopped in and handed over a field trip something or other for a prize. Both seemed rather happy IMHO. That is something that I think should be encouraged continually.\n\nPro Tip #2: The parking lot is closed when the Audubon center is =X\n\nDefinitely a fun quick freebee kinda place to stop in and burn an hour or stop by after a hike... it makes for some relaxed nature interaction, even for a grown up... or someone who refuses to grow up like me =)"}],"streetAddress":"4700 North Griffin Ave","postalCode":"90031","name":"Audubon Center at Debs Park","rating":"5.0","phonenumber":" 323-221-2255","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

The Drum Barracks Civil War Museum is an amazing part of Los Angeles history. Who knew that Los Angeles had a connection to the American Civil War? Indeed it did and the history comes live in the Drum Barracks. \n\nCalifornia was relatively new to the US when the Civil War began. It was California gold that helped finance a good portion of the Union's efforts in the Civil War. 3,000 Union soldiers were sent to protect the Los Angeles harbor at San Pedro and here the story begins.\nThe soldiers were housed in several buildings but very little remains but thankfully, what became known as the Drum Barracks survived the years and is wedged in a residential neighborhood.\nThe Museum has been lovingly preserved and is worth visit for anyone fascinated with history. \n\nThe museum is open for guided tours and on a very limited schedule so be sure to check their website for tours. I was lucky to be the only person on my tour and had a most remarkable experience with a young guide who loved history and was willing to take his time to explain the artifacts in each room. Each room has a true connection to the Civil War and one of my favorite items was an actual Gatling Gun.\n\nThe Drum Barracks also has another unique claim to history. It was here that several camels were housed during an ill-fated experiment to use camels in the military. Here is one very special museum that locals and visitors should not miss.\n\nJust down the street is the beautiful Banning House museum that is another must see. A short distance away is San Pedro and the harbor. The museum has a very nice gift shop with items relating to the Civil War.

Los Angeles has a huge Thai population, many living in North Hollywood, just south of this temple. The best time to go is on Sundays or during a Thai festival. Last year, I visited the temple during the Thai New Year (Songkran festival) which happens mid-April and it was pretty amazing - live music, lots of people, tons of cheap food stalls.\n\nOn Sundays, there is a modest food court downstairs that sells typical Thai fare like Pad Thai, papaya salad and iced coffees. Most of the dishes are are around $3-7. The proceeds go to the monks and the temple.\n\nParking is available on the streets in the surrounding neighborhoods, as well as at the Temple - entrance is on Cantara Street.

I was made welcome to sit down and share some delicious leftover Thai food. I am not sure if this was unique as nobody spoke English and I was not able to ask. I was not asked for money but made a small donation inside the Temple. Those of you who are familiar with the Thai people will know of their extraordinary generosity.

You would think in the Los Angeles area there would be many singers, actors, dancers, wannabe directors who could pull off topnotch entertainment. Not so here. For $15 a ticket, \"quality theater\" takes on a poorly-directed, primary school, dummed-down aspect. The actors didn't know their lines well and had no rapport with the children in the audience. The whole show was not well thought out and completely unmemorable right down to the props. The production we saw was delayed to wait for a party to arrive. Fifteen minutes later, the group was a no-show. Several announcements were made for children to go to the restroom during the wait because it was located behind the stage.

A traveling exhibit on Animal Grossology was very interesting, but a little gross, but won't be there long before a new traveling exhibit takes its place.

The LA Cube's official address is NOT where you want to try parking. We followed my phone's Google Maps to 11800 Foothill Blvd, looked around, and could NOT figure out where the heck we were supposed to go. After parallel parking on the street outside an apartment complex, we walked around and finally found a security guard by the delivery entrance who clued us into the real directions. Don't make the same mistake we did. (In other words, go down Dronfield into the Hansen Dam parking lot).\n\nWe're Cube members and have already been to the Orange County one many times, so there was a lot about the LA Cube that was familiar: The Eco Challenge shopping cart thing with the handheld scanners, the Race to Recycle truck game, and the Inspector Training are all nearly identical to OC. Science of Hockey, the Aquavator, and the Helicopter Tour are also there. But at least most of it is newer. Race to Recycle at OC is old, has fewer items, and a lot of their items are missing yellow stars. The Aquavator is bigger and has two screens. And the LA Helicopter Tour is much more scenic (and motion sick-inducing) than OC. Hockey is sponsored by the LA Kings instead of the Anaheim Ducks, but otherwise the exhibit equipment is all the same. \n\nNo Dino Quest. No Rocket Lab. No Shake Shack. Not much else going on, really. It felt like the place was less than half the size of the OLD OC Cube, let alone after Orange County's expansion. Plus, they seemed understaffed. For example, there wasn't anyone manning the Helicopter Tour exhibit, so pretty much anyone could walk in whenever they wanted, which was distracting.\n\nThe big benefit to the LA cube for people who have been to OC is that LA has different featured exhibits. While OC is running Hot Wheels right now, LA has Curious George. And LA is also much cheaper at $10\/admission for now.\n\nAll in all, my kids enjoyed both the familiarity of OC Cube exhibits and also the excitement of being somewhere \"new\". I'm not sure we'd make the trek all the way to LA just to visit this place, but if you're in the area and need to kill an hour (or two hours, max), then stop on by."}],"streetAddress":"10800 Foothill Boulevard","postalCode":"91342","name":"Discovery Cube Los Angeles","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" (866) 552-2823","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

The place raises this artistic phenomenon to an entirely new plane.\n\nHand over $10 (look, they need support, ok?), and you can browse on your own in a handful of tiny rooms chock full of velvet paintings. Some of the rooms are themed (think Elvis, nudes (adults only, please), black light), and interesting hand written descriptions tell you all you ever wanted to know about black velvet paintings.\n\nIt's fun, it's cute, quirky, and worth a detour. The owner\/s are often there, will share their insight and knowledge with you, and talk about how they got into this crazy idea in the first place! Caren Anderson and Carol Baldwin have over 3,000 paintings, and about 450 are displaced at any time.\n\nIn addition, there are special smaller exhibits that are worth notice, usually closer to the floor, such as a unique Unicorn Birthing Center and a special shrine to \"Dog, The Bounty Hunter\". \n\nBy the way, this little gem is just 2 blocks from Phillipe the Original birthplace of the French dipped sandwich), in the center of Chinatown, and near Olvera Street and Union Station.....so you can make a day of it if you wish!"},{"review":"If you're visiting and want something different and non-touristy to do, or if you're a local who has yet to venture downtown, this is a great place to start. This funky little Chinatown storefront is run by a down to earth bohemian couple who sincerely love the art of velvet painting. It's tongue in cheek and serious at the same time.

The collection changes every couple months, and it's always good, whether kitsch or straight forward, most paintings are amazingly well crafted.\n\nIt's $10, takes about an hour, and when you're done, walk two short blocks to Phillipe the Original for a killer french dip.

Cal Worthington with his \"dog\" Spot. And scattered among the pictures of dogs playing poker are some pieces that are stunningly beautiful - true works of art!

What I didn't realize was that there's WAAAAY more behind the curtain. This is a well-curated and fascinating collection of velvet paintings and other related items that was pure entertainment. There's even a room of nudes and black-light paintings, and definitely ask to see the bathroom. (Especially if you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain. I won't say more than that.)\n\nThe owner was fantastic, and was half the experience. She has great stories, and knows a ton about art history.

I'll admit that I was not particularly interested in paying $10 to look at kitschy velvet paintings, but I was more than pleasantly surprised by this museum. If you think that velvet painting is just garish renditions of clowns or Elvis, think again. While there were plenty of clown and Elvis paintings in the museum, there were also lovely Tahitian paintings by American artist Edgar Leetag and the painting of a WWII pilot by Louis Behan was amazing in its detail. (Just take a look at the pilot's map!) I was also fascinated by the history of the velvet paintings commissioned by American servicemen in Vietnam for their wives and mothers. \n\nOne of the owners, Carl Baldwin, was there when we visited and his enthusiasm for velvet painting and its history was boundless. His guided tour of part of the collection was fascinating and gave us a real appreciation of this art form."},{"review":"I had read a review about the velvet painting museum in the LA Times a few months back.

What amazes me every time I stare out into the Pacific is the proximity of Catalina Island. The park provides easy terrain for hiking with mild elevation. Most of the park can be hiked within 2 hours and it makes a great early morning or late afternoon\/evening destination to get a walk in. Great place to catch a sunset as well. Flora and fauna are in abundance as this park is in the middle of a project to reclaim its more natural state after being used as a military defense point up through the 70s. The defense structures that still exist are definitely worth checking out. I've yet to make it down to the tide pools across the road but plan to at some point. The visitor center is only open on Wednesdays and the weekends. White Point State Park is where a large stretch of W. Paseo Del Mar Road collapsed to the beach and sea below. The only route to get here is down Western Ave. now. A great aspect about this park is the sparse population, and most of them being locals.

However, look beyond the fence and you'll see people milling about the ruins, sitting and admiring the breathtaking ocean view, or even tagging the old rubble. \n\nTo enter, head to Point Fermin Park and go towards Walker's Cafe. Go to the fence, that blocks off the Sunken City, and look to your right. There will be a huge hole that somebody dug allowing access into the area. Worry not, there are people that enter the supposed-forbidden area all the time. Alternatively, on the corner of Shepard St and Bluff Place, one can also jump over the fence into the area. \n\nNow, to the actual Sunken City...All the rubble that you see are actual parts of roads\/sidewalks that sank in the 1930's. Ocean rifts caused the roads to collapse and float out into the ocean. There's a street called Paseo Del Mar and the sunken roads are\/were part of this street. Paseo still exists today, but it's interesting to think that a part of this road actually collapsed. \n\nFor people a fear of heights, I wouldn't recommend this place. The bluff is pretty high up and the trek down into the actual broken streets is pretty steep. However, there are just absolutely marvelous views of the Pacific Ocean, especially on a clear, gorgeous sunny LA day. It's worth walking along the path; it's probably about 1\/4\" of a mile in length. However, do maintain caution as the roads are at various degrees which lead to steep climbs. Admire the graffiti the taggers have claimed. \n\nThe Sunken City is just a really neat part of LA and even more interesting to know why it sunk. Highly recommended especially to those that like to venture off the beaten path."},{"review":"To Whom it May Concern, I am a police officer with the LAPD Harbor Division, which includes San Pedro. Currently the area known as \"Sunken City\" is closed to the public; there is a perimeter fence and no trespassing signs posted to illustrate this fact. We recently did a sweep of the area and cited a large number of people for trespassing. Everyone cited will have to appear in court before and judge and will be facing penalties of up to 6 months in jail or a $1,000.00 fine. Make no mistake about it, if you are caught trespassing in Sunken City by Law Enforcement, you will be cited and or arrested and will then be facing a similar consequence."}],"streetAddress":"500 W Paseo Del Mar","postalCode":"90731","name":"Sunken City","rating":"4.0","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

It's a great ride, relatively flat and a mostly well maintained path. I ride the river several times a week and routinely see ducks, cranes and blue herons. I also see homeless people pretty regularly but have never had any altercations or problems with them.\nThere are several entrance\/ exit points and it's fun to get off of the path and explore, especially in Griffith Park.

The parking structure has been a running joke to locals for many years -- it can be horribly complicated and congested -- but in recent years has improved. However, I find myself going to this mall less and less when I visit LA, for one main reason -- the food court is simply blasted with music and tv adverts from all directions. Wherever you try to sit, there are tv screens staring down at you, blaring out horrible noise. It is simply impossible to relax and enjoy food (let alone conversation -- don't even try to talk like a normal human being with so much background noise); and it's even more annoying to think that the mall is trying to sell you things while you sit and eat. It is incredibly unpleasant. And now that the Century City mall has such an attractive outdoor eating area, in addition to the very nice selection of stores and the fantastic cinema, there's just little reason to put up with the onslaught of noise at the Pavilion."},{"review":"Plenty of good and designer shops this outside Mall is clean and well serviced.

We shopped in Forever 21 and found some great deals on costume jewelry. We went to Macy's and we were surmised that they did not have as much selection of purses and clothes as the Macy's in Victoria Gardens.

A reasonable food court again with a decent cross section of food establishments.\nHowever, try to get to the movie side of the place and good luck on finding a parking spot. You have to figure on getting to the pavilion at least 1\/2 hour before the movie starts. If you do not, good chance the battle for an elite parking spot will become more like a joust with a good chance your car, might get dinged. This happens during the prime time movie slots every time I have gone there. \nThe entrances also are very tough to manage as both entrances and exits end on Pico Blvd. which is a busy street and with limited access. \nLike the movie theatre , the parking is bad, very bad."},{"review":"The first time visiting this mall and the parking was a nightmare. People stop and wait for cars to leave their space, and then you wait. The food court was a challenge to reach, but is possible. Depends on where you enter the mall.

It is absolutely stunning, and the gateway to some of the best hiking in Southern California. But it is a windy, mountain road, and there are very few passing lanes. So please! If you want to drive slowly and enjoy the views, pull over at the frequent pullouts, and let those who want to drive faster go by. If you don't, they will be tempted to pass you unsafely on a blind curve. Every weekend there are accidents on this road, mostly motorcycles and people in fast cars using it as a race track. There aren't enough police to enforce the speed limits, so please don't try to do it yourself. If you want to stop and park and hike at all, you will need a Wilderness Permit ($5 day pass at most ranger stations or you can get an annual pass for about $30)."},{"review":"This is a gorgeous way to approach Los Angeles - heaps more scenic than the freeway. We entered at the eastern end and finished up at La Canada. \n\nThe views are spectacular and completely different from what else I'd seen around Los Angeles. There are a lot of turn outs where you can stop and take photos or a break from driving. The road is very windy and some drop-offs are stomach churning. If you've been researching doing this drive you'll have read about numerous accidents - don't do this is you are a nervous driver or passenger! This is an active drive and best done by experienced, sensible drivers.\n\nThe road was of very good quality although there were a few rocks scattered here and there. You'd definitely need to be careful of ice in winter as there was still snow in shady places in April."},{"review":"It was a beautiful day, the sun beat down\nI had the radio on, I was drivin'\nTrees flew by, me and Del were singin' little Runaway\nI was flyin'\n\nThis is exactly how I feel when cruisin Angeles Crest. One of my all time favorite roads to drive anywhere.\n\nIt has Twisties, Vistas, occasionally Snow, hikes, camping, and dare I say it... NATURE! It's crazy. You can experience so much great stuff on this drive regardless of your wanting to be touristy or beaten down the road on a bike or sliding turns like you're a D-1 supastah! This is such a fun road to cruise.\n\nPro Tip: This road goes from Glendale to Wrightwood Hwy 2 to Hwy 138 (lets out at the 15)\n\nIt helps that there are not a lot of slowpoke looky loos as you can get around them if you are cruizen as its 4 lanes , but it is also a very well kept road that leads to some of the best hikes around. Want to go camping? Well this is a place that has some kewl campgrounds or places to hike and camp overnight not super far off. This could also be a great bicycle ride if you are feeling daring and want to work on your hill climbs.\n\nPro Tip #2: The road is usually closed in the winter as it is not plowed.\n\nSo essentially this road dances down the mountain range that is on the North Eastern edge of the LA basin and corrals the entire area. On the other side of the range is the desert.\n\nIf you have never had a chance to drive this road, get off your butt and check it out sometime. It is spectacular and well worth it.

One is called \"Water Is Life\" and the other is called \"Centered In The Universe\". We saw both of them and I suggest you do the same. It cost $7.00 per person ($5.00 for seniors) for each show. They follow each other with a break of about 20 minutes. You will marvel at each show. They are great. Than you can wander around the planetarium which is free and look at all kinds of exhibits about space and the stars. They have a small cafeteria where you can grab a sandwich and a small gift shop. Take time to walk around the outside of the building. Because it is up so high you have a wonderful view if LA and the surrounding area including the \"Hollywood Sign\""},{"review":"The staff is wonderful. Our son had a question and they took a lot of time to not only explain it to him, but everyone who was there. We really enjoyed the show and the lady narrating it was amazing. Could have listened to her talk forever. We made sure to compliment her at the end of the show. The highlight was at night, being able to see Venus and Jupiter through the telescopes. Such an amazing experience for our 17 year old who loves Planetariums. This was the best one we have been to by far. Traffic was awful as it was Memorial Day weekend, but was well worth the hike from our parking spot up to the place as the views are amazing. Would highly recommended this place."},{"review":"We attended an evening performance of 'Centered in the Universe' and thoroughly enjoyed it. Traffic was heavy as we approached the Observatory, created by people arriving to watch the sunset, so leave plenty of time to get here and find somewhere to park - we had to park on Western Canyon Road and walk up the hill.\nThe Planetarium seating swivels back to position viewers facing the dome, we sat in the centre of the auditorium and had an excellent 270 degree view. None of us experienced any adverse sensations during the film, despite being warned that it might create some motion sickness.\nThe film we saw is a mix of classic planetarium projection and movie - all of which was expertly narrated live by a member of staff within the auditorium. It was fairly ambitious in the range of material covered but gave a good overview of the historical changes in astronomical theory.\nBy the way, you are not allowed to eat or dink in the auditorium - no popcorn or soda here!"},{"review":"This place is amazing.\nEverything but the Planetarium Show is free...and even that is ridiculously cheap at 7$.\nAside from an outstanding 30 min show, you get a great view over LA, there's telescopes set up for just anyone to look through and of course the big telescope with a brilliant view of the moon.\nEven though i've seen everything you can see there, i will go there again at some point."},{"review":"The planetarium is in the Observatory at Griffith Park. Directions to the Observatory are well marked within the Park. Parking is free, and was abundant on the afternoon which we visited. Restrooms are also abundant,well marked,clean, and free.

We saw \"Centered in the Universe\".All of us were favorably impressed, and all of the comments made by folks as they left the theater, were raves.

Cheviot Hills has some of the prettiest streets and lovely homes in suburban LA (not including the neighborhoods with mansions -- which are just pretentious and unfriendly areas), and it's smack in the middle of West LA. I highly recommend to anyone who needs a little exercise -- go with a friend, or a dog, or some chill music, and take a long (one hour+) walk around Rancho Park and the surrounding Cheviot Hills neighborhood. It's relaxing and pleasing. Plus, you get to see the streets where Modern Family is shot. .."},{"review":"We came here for to Cheviot Hills Park for the \"Celebrate Israel\" 67th Anniversary (we also came here 2 years ago for the 65th Anniversary.

Very affordable and adventurous."},{"review":"Andrew's group of us 9 people, just jelled like I couldn't have imagined-interesting and diverse yet we all had much in common. In Cuba, we had the most warm and hospitable guide (and our personal driver for the tour) EVER through historical Havana, an excursion to the gorgeous beach of Varadero-wow!, and out to Vinales where the landscape is majestic with the BEST meal ever at an organic farm house were some highlights. Plenty of free time to explore on our own...and also the art flee market... With such a high literacy rate, the Cuban people are so very lovely. Yes! Thank you Coast to Costa!"},{"review":"I am a busy person. I am in 3 bands and I nanny 2 two year old boys 40 hours a week. I knew I was in desperate need of a vacation but funds are tight and honestly.. I just didn't want to have to THINK about anythings such as travel arrangements, where to eat etc. for 165 I felt completely taken care of! all I had to do was square cash the money to Coasttocosta and be at union station at 8:30 am. EVERYTHING else was taken care of! We ate THE BEST ceviche. we drank delicious craft beer. we went to a beautiful winery and drank some more there. we ended the night at an amazing local restaurant where we ate delicious food talked conversed and watched the sun set! i will DEFINITELY be doing this again and I will tell all of my friends!"},{"review":"Did we just become best friends? These groups not only boast a guide who can easily navigate the local culture, language and find THE best spots you've never heard of before... but you're surrounded by other food-and-fun-loving travelers. I've traveled to Mexico before, but my first trip with Coast to Costa was going somewhere I've never been before: Ensenada and the Baja wine region of Valle de Guadalupe. Pick-up, border crossing and all commuting throughout the region went smoothly. This daytrip was jam-packed (but not overly so) with activities at places I've been dying to try and which I never would have discovered on my own. Starting with world-renowned seafood food card and ending with a 4-course dinner at one of the top-rated restaurants in Latin America... with plenty of microbrews, artisan cheeses and wine tasting in between. Andrew kept everyone in a great mood and I never once worried about my safety. Usually opting to travel alone and doing all the dirty planning work, I found every part of this experience to be a profound cultural immersion in a new place with lovely people. Great work Coast to Costa! I cannot wait to join in again soon!"},{"review":"I went on a Coast to Costa weekend excursion to Baja California with a group of people from L.A. and S.D. I got to eat some of the most amazing contemporary Mexican cuisine I've ever had including cheese tastings, wine tastings, craft Mexican beer, and menu tastings. I don't know the other people before the trip but they were all really cool and fun to travel with which makes all the difference for this kind of group excursion. It is great for couples, groups of friends, and coworkers.The Valle de Guadalupe completely blew my mind--still pretty undiscovered and one of the most unique and beautiful parts of Mexico. Those Californians who know about should consider themselves lucky. Thanks to Andrew for introducing us to this Baja renaissance so close to home."},{"review":"My girlfriend and I took an amazing trip to Oaxaca with Coast to Costa. What a time. After 5 days of being in and around Oaxaca we just loved it. We felt that we'd seen almost everything there was to see, all made possible by the man, our leader, organizer, facilitator, and for many of us, translator. He paid such great attention to detail with all of our set plans and struck a nice balance between structured activity and allowing us time to explore on our own. Not only did we thoroughly explore the city, we toured the surrounding areas to soak in the culture of the greater Oaxaca region. It was beautiful. \n\nMost importantly, Andrew created a welcome and communal atmosphere that promoted coming together between existing and new friends. Having loathed group tours in the past, this completely changed my perspective on how one can and should be executed. If you're looking for a helluva tour with great company that you can make your own if you'd like, try this on. Highly recommended and already planning to try another of his trips. Ole!"},{"review":"It was the most warm and welcoming experience. It was the perfect amount of rest and getting to see the sights and getting to know the people. I loved the group!"},{"review":"Andrew led a group of me and my friends through a perfectly selected series of amusements and sustenance in downtown LA. I'll admit, I wasn't so thrilled with the prospect of traipsing around in a city that is \nknown for its lack of pedestrian-friendliness, but Andrew totally changed my perspective on downtown. The pacing of stops was great - I never felt like we were somewhere too long, nor did I feel rushed. He also provided us with a nice balance of food, drink, history, and miscellany.\n\nTo top it all off, Andrew is a super nice guy. Very laid back, but you could still tell that he had control of the situation. He's real personable and funny. \n\nA very good deal for all that you get. Highly recommend."},{"review":"I traveled to Barcelona with Coast to Costa and it was, without a doubt, one of the best decisions I have ever made. Having never been to Barcelona, I was able to experience the city from the perspective of a local, thanks to Andrew. Everything was handpicked and high quality, from the restaurants and hotel accommodations to the unique and authentic tours of local markets and beaches. Andrew was an incredibly insightful and charismatic guide, and his knowledge of Spanish culture and general hospitality made this one of the best trips of my life!\n\nBy traveling with Coast to Costa I was able to explore Barcelona in a way that would not have been possible otherwise. This was such a unique experience and I can't wait for my next Coast to Costa adventure!"},{"review":"I don't even know where to start. I went on the trip to Sayulita and had the most amazing, adventurous, beautiful time. Andrew is the BEST person to travel with. Not only is he hilarious, but he's always on the hunt for ways to truly experience living like a local. By the end of the 5 day trip, we were having drinks with the restaurant owners, watching sunsets with our surf instructors, and hugging our trip-mates that we met just a few days before. \n\nThe pacing of the entire trip was exactly what I needed. Although we did a ton, it was never too much. Sure we would drink, but it was never too crazy. I literally came back from the trip feeling reset and energized. BONUS! I got a pretty nice tan, too. \n\nEveryone in the group were genuine, super fun people that were game for anything. I think it has a lot to do with Andrew. He just knows how to keep the energy going and make people feel like a family. We even helped one of our trip mates propose on a secluded beach!

The Tar Pits themselves are more than worth a visit to understand the tragic (for the poor animals) history. It is fascinating to see the scientists working on discoveries made in the tar pits and there is still active excavation occurring. The museum is reviewed separately under the La Brea Tar Pits listing though. You can get the 720 bus from right outside the Tar Pits Musuem (on Wilshire) right through to Santa Monica for $1.75.

It is now closed, but we had a chance to ride it in 2010. It begins at the lower level on a single track, and about midway expands to a double track so that the cars (named Sinai and Olivet) can pass one another. The interiors of the cars are quintessentially Victorian and have no restraints or other comfort features on the wooden seats. The fare used to be 50-cents, but no one knows what the fare will be when - or if - it will reopen. There are nearby restaurants top and bottom, and plenty of parking. It was quite a ride, and we thoroughly enjoyed it!"},{"review":"Having ridden one of the last car rides up and down Bunker Hill to and from Grand Central Market decades ago before the grand mansions fell to the wrecker's ball and the entire hill was leveled, this simply was more like a short Disneyland ride than the once historical thrill it was.\n\nNice try Los Angeles, but you committed municipal vandalism by destroying an important remnant of your historical culture."},{"review":"In the heart of LA's business district this iconic funicular railway is a great place to take the kids or to enjoy a bit of the history of the city.

Would love to have more content about time and space and artistic development. Wish their lighting was better as the glare of the lights really compromises many of the glassed in pieces of art.

It may not be the nicest of beaches in California, but it gets the job done as somewhere close enough that is nice enough. Parking right next to the beach is reasonable (about $9) if you park for the day, otherwise you could venture onto one of the side streets off PCH and try to find something there, but may be a bit difficult. Overall, would recommend."},{"review":"I returned to Will Rogers Beach again this year and found it still to be a great place to hang out, swim and catch some rays. This time I went to the far end of the beach, almost to Pacific Palisaides and found free parking at the side of the road and a nice wooden stairway from the PCH down to the beach. There were some surfers there, but not much else going on, which is nice if you are looking for quiet. The main beach south of this end has a $9 entry fee which I saved on the two days I was at the beach. With the busy Pacific Coast Highway above there is little if any road noise to disturb the ocean sound. I had to go a bit north of the beach to turn around and come back to it from the north since I had come from the Santa Monica area."},{"review":"Locals will tell you this beach is rarely crowded since it doesn't have all of the bars, etc. that a lot of the other stretches have. This was perfect for our family as it left plenty of room for building sandcastles and running. There are lifeguards and restrooms with showers...but unlike other reviewers our experience was not that they were the cleanest. The outdoor showers do come in handy for rinsing all of the sand off though. Beautiful spot for walks on the beach and saw several couples enjoying picnics while watching the perfect view of the sunset!"},{"review":"We went to Will Rogers State Beach.

These rooms were where stars such as Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe had their hair done. It cost $15 each."},{"review":"We visited the museum after reading other favorable reviews and found that they were absolutely right!\n\nThe museum is really the Max Factor museum, although it has lots more. The centerpiece of the museum is a set of color rooms where Max developed makeup for stars - e.g. the redhead room (Lucille Ball), the blonde room (Marilyn Monroe). There's a nice documentary film of Max's life and the company's growth. And then there's the rest - a great collection of film and tv memorabilia, with emphasis on makeup and costume. A real nostalgia trip for those who like old movies and shows, as I do. And if you do too, this is a must-see.\n\nOne warning - parking in the public lot across the street is $20 for the day, no hourly rate.\n"},{"review":"Me and my wife enjoyed ourselves. \nPro's \n1. Pretty affordable tickets\n2. Several floors of memorabilia \n3. Old Hollywood actresses and actors\n4. A decent sci-fi section\n5. Awesome horror section in the basement.\n\nCon's \n1. Parking sucks, dont park in lot next to diner, guy lies and says no where else to park. If u drive around block on the street behind the museum there is metered parking spots.\n2. Some of costumes and displays are not original. You can tell they have outfits they pieced together and make it appear that it is actual memorabilia.\n3. Everything is behind glass and it makes for bad pictures in low lighting and no flash allowed.\n4. They take up a lot of space on reality tv costumes and to me its not exciting.\n"},{"review":"It was a fun place to visit with so much memorabilia. From Dorothy's red slippers, to Pee Wee Herman's bike and the suit he wore, to the actual glass cell from Silence of the Lambs.

Fun to visit"},{"review":"Its the old Max factor building and thats probably the best part.\n\nThere are so many movie and TV costumes, but a costume is a costume... you're in Hollywood, you need to see the real actor, right?\n\nHowever for the money it passes an hour or so....\n\nIf you're with under 25yr olds then there isn't a lot for them to see."},{"review":"The Hollywood Museum was recommended to us by Brian from the Dearly Departed tour. We had the Go Los Angeles card, and the Hollywood Museum was included on that card. We went on Nov 1 around 3pm. There are technically 4 floors in this building, so the self guided tour could take some time to look at everything, so be aware. The basement was awesome & scary....beware of Jason upon entering the basement, he scared the crap out of us! The 1st floor with all the Max Factor makeup was really interesting, I enjoyed seeing all the rooms where Lucille Ball & Marilyn Monroe got their \"looks\" from. There is a lot of great history in this museum!"},{"review":"Visited Mels next door to rest the feet after the walk of fame.\nOur reciept entitled us to a discount so we thought why not.\n\nInteresting collection of what seemed to be authentic items displayed in a lovely old building.

It has a decent collection of movie memorabilia arranged along a theme, and what they don't have originals of, they have decent replicas. There is really no theme to the whole thing; I suspect the owners threw in whatever they could get their hands on. If you are a true movie fan, this may be worth it; otherwise, you may feel it isn't worth your time\/money.

It was also the only mission currently 'owned' by a non Native American, being on a rancho owned by the then-current mayor of the Pueblo of Los Angeles. San Fernando was a prosperous agrarian community, with around 30,000 vines and around 21,000 head of sheep and cattle. It was famed for its blacksmithing work, some of which remains in the 'long house' windows to this day. It was also the favourite place to stay for travellers along the El Camino Real. This was in large part because of the Friars' reputation for hospitality. That reputation was so widely known that the Padres had to accommodate visitors by building a 'convento' or hotel for them in the form of a 'long house' with 21 arches extending for almost 250 feet and 50 feet wide! The mission proper consisted of a simple church and quadrangle in addition to the 'long house' which nowadays makes up most of the surviving mission. There was damage in the 1812 quake which also harmed several other missions. With secularisation in the 1830s came decay. And then 'it' happened! In 1842 - 6 years before gold was discovered in Northern California - a well educated mineralogist ''Californio' who resided near San Fernando noticed some flecks of gold clinging to the roots of some onions being harvested in a field. The rush was on, and everything that could be dug up, was dug up, including the mission fields, quadrangle grounds, and even the floor of the church! A few years later this mini-rush was just a memory, but by then the damage had been done. The mission buildings were sold off, being used as a stagecoach station, warehouses and even a hog farm. By 1852 there was again a parish priest at the mission. grounds. In 1861 the mission ruins and 55 surrounding acres were returned to Catholic ownership. Restoration efforts began in the late 1890s.mmthere was a discovery in 1920 of a buried Russian American bell, probably dating from an early 19th century trading expedition from Alaska to the mission. By 1923 the mission was staffed by the Oblate Order of Fathers, and remains so to this day. There is a museum and gift shop with self guided tours, admission $4 per adult. Open 9 am to 4 pm. Masses at the mission church, Sunday 9 and 10:30. From the south, take the I-405 north to exit 71-B, you will be on Orion Avenue. Go to the first corner and turn right, the mission will be on your left. From the north, take the I-405 south to exit 72, and at the end of the ramp you will be on Rinaldi. Go under the freeway and turn right onto Sepulveda. Go,south on Sepulveda to San Fernando Mission Blvd. and turn left. The mission will be on your left., enjoy!"},{"review":"Great place for children in or entering 4th grade since their Social Studies will focus on early California life and the missions. \n\nEnter through the gift shop ($3). There is a beautiful court yard leading up to the church. There are multiple rooms with artifacts and art of the time as well as a few rooms left to look as they were in the past.

It's a good distraction if you run out of things to do in Hollywood, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this attraction because it's not really worth the time \/ money. One thing I found entertaining was that you could dress up in clothes and accessories and take photos with the wax figures (For instance, there is a hat and a glove near MJ's statue and you can wear them and take photos with the wax figure). Also, compared to the Guinness World Records Museum and the Ripley's Believe It or Not in Hollywood, this place is much better actually. If you must go, go late in the evening (it's open till 10 p.m. or so) or first thing during a weekday morning to avoid crowds.

I have been to the Hollywood Wax Museum in Branson and L.A. now. I loved the variety of characters here especially freaked out when I saw Marilyn Monroe and Lucille Ball in the same room!! However, Marilyn did not look even close to the real deal. Lucy was spot on. I loved the Ninja Turtles-brought me back to my childhood days. A major highlight for me was the P!nk wax figure on the way out. P!nk is my FAVORITE singer so imagine my surprise when we were almost done and saw her! This is a small place and you can get through it within an hour or so.

While it was a fun way to kill time it was certainly not the most interesting of everything else available to do in LA. \n\nIt is almost a tourist trap as it is located centrally on Hollywood Boulevard and could easily be sold to you as you are walking by viewing other famous landmarks. \n\nFamilies with kids might enjoy it more as it is a bit interactive and gives you lots of fun photos with celebrities, interesting findings and world records all around the world. \n\nI have been to Madame Tussads before and personally feel that the wax figures in MT are more realistic and way better than the ones in the HWM. All 3 places took us about 2 hours to cover. Overall though, if given an opportunity we would have passed this option and done another studio tour or theme park instead."},{"review":"I don't have any other wax museum experiences to contrast my review but this was not what I expected to see. It was an experience and now I can say that I've been there and done that. Pro-Tip: Purchase the 3 attraction pass and you'll get entry into the Hollywood Wax Museum, the Ripley's Believe it or Not Museum and the Genus Book of World Records Museum and have 3 days to use your passes. The standard price for one person to visit one attraction is $16 and the 3 attraction pass costs $32 so it's basically buy 2 get 1 free. \n\nI unfortunately didn't have the time to visit all three attractions so we chose the one we were standing in front of which was the Hollywood wax museum. The first thing that I noticed was that the celebrities did look like themselves but then again they didn't. It's like they put detail in them but just enough. I really think that they could step it up a bit and really make the figures look more like the people. Some of the figures were just standing around and other figures were the celebs dressed in some of their memorable acting roles. I would much rather have just seen the celebs in their natural looking form. They have a horror movie exhibit and it is pretty cool and the new zombie feature is awesome even though it has nothing to do with wax whatsoever. The space could be used better throughout the museum as well. Some figures have an entire room to themselves while other figures are stacked on top of each other. They have a TV that was showing how the figures are made but it was very hard to hear due to the other noise that is present in the museum so we didn't really take in the show. I don't know if it reveals whether or not they figures match the height and body type of the actual humans but some of the figures seemed really off. Vin Diesel was too skinny and so was Ben Affleck. Jennifer Aniston barely looked like Jennifer Aniston and there were two figures that I couldn't even recognize. Eminem should have been easy to recognize but my daughter had to tell me who he was. They have a figure of Dictator Obama posed so that you can snap a photo of you shaking hands with him but I hate that they even have him there at all.

Shuttles are no hassle quick way of getting there. Most all seats are good as it is relatively small. Weather was comfortable but needed a sweater later on during the concert.

Bike hire was competitive - there are a dozen hire shops along Santa Monica beach alone - but not cheap. Then again, nor is anything in LA, so no complaints on that score!\n\nWe didn't have time to cycle the whole 22 miles of the bike trail, but instead cycled from Santa Monica to Marina Del Ray, past Venice Beach, and back again. The trail is good, mostly composed of paved concrete with separate lanes for cyclists and pedestrians, and the views are stunning - classic SoCal beach on the one side, complete with volleyball courts and outdoor gym equipment, and a bustling mish-mash of shops, cafes and houses on the other side, with a colourful (if somewhat stereotypical) array of street vendors thrown in. There are lots of places to chain your bike up, so stopping to eat, play or shop is no problem. I would recommend cycling earlier in the morning - it gets very hot in the early afternoon - but perhaps that's the chronic vitamin-D deficiency of a Scot talking. We were visiting midweek in September, and while the bike trail was well-used, there was no sense of crowding.\n\nThe only negative to the experience was that the beaches along Santa Monica and Venice, while beautiful, are also surprisingly polluted. We stopped briefly to head down to the ocean, and in the space of 5 minutes my husband managed to get crude oil on his feet, which is a pain to get off. Fortunately, the beaches are well supplied with outdoor shower blocks (and inside toilets), but we paid more attention to the cleanliness of the sand after that, and noticed a number of patches of crude oil. Otherwise a pleasant experience, and a nice change from the business of downtown LA."}],"streetAddress":"Temescal Canyon Rd. and Pacific Coast Hwy.","name":"South Bay Bicycle Trail","rating":"4.5","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

In fact the non profit organization that operates the ship as a museum usually hosts 3 ocean cruises per year where they recreate the past for a full day cruise in the Catalina Channel of the Coast of Southern California. Guns blazing as World War II vintage airplanes attack the ship! A great buffet style lunch was always a treat! If you enjoy history take this full day trip out to sea or just stop by and tour the on board museum."},{"review":"Utility information for those who may have special needs:\nThis place has bathroom. Unlike some big ship. Yay. I am looking at you, IOWA.\nNot wheel chair accessible except for some part of the deck.\nStairs are steep in most cases (also narrow).\n\nFirst thing first, this is a place for those who really like navy\/ww2 stuff, therefore if you are not a fan of such (not an enthusiasts to be honest), don't mark this place on your plan. (although the scenery view around this place is oaky. Well, just oaky).However, if you are , to some extent, greatly interested in this ship (provided that you have some basic knowledge about it), then continue reading the review. Otherwise go check out somewhere else.\n\nThe reason I give this a 5 out of 5 is (I prefer 10-points scale, just saying) 3 points for its value, 1 points for the tour guide (my family is the only tour group in that ship at that time, so I assume the tour guide is not something that happens all the time. But in the other hand, not many people go to place.) and 1 more points for its surprisingly large amount of displaying collection.\n\nThis ship is still functional and cruise every summer (not for 2014, it was under repair and maintenance).So if you are going to LA at the summer, consider it. The ship also has a lot chambers which you can go in and immersing into your imagination which takes you about 70 years back (Gosh, I zoned out again). and on each walk ways you can see the placards which contains the info of the its lost sister ships (some are not the Victory model, so distant cousin ships) and those who scarified along. There are also two large chambers below the deck which stores a lot collection for display. Be sure two visit both location.\n\nSince this ship is a cargo ship, it has been widely used across the globe during the war time (including Korean war), which resulted in large amount records of ration supplied to each places and how they affected the war or wear affected by the war. Really vivid demonstration of its usefulness, and a great aspect of learning the history. It also has some information about the path of cargo ship development.\n\nI walk around the ship for about 3 hours, and not get bored at all. (if it is not because they are going to close, I will stay longer) This place worth at least two hours of your time. Plan ahead."},{"review":"The directions to the ship are easy to follow and visit did not disappoint. Constructed in WWII, this ship languished for many years in Suisan Bay before being selected for conversion to a museum - and what a great job has been done by the volunteers who spent their own time bringing it back to life.\nAll areas are usually open but during my visit there was no access to the engine room because the boilers were being re-tubed. When this work is completed the ship will then commence its programme of regular cruises around the area - something I would have enjoyed but sadly not this time.\nThe explanatory placards describing the working of the 20mm and 40mm guns were well written and clearly followed. \nThe memorials located throughout the passageways to the U.S. Merchant ships and crews lost during WWII were moving reminders of the price paid for our freedom. They provided a description of the loss and also the fate of the U-Boat that sank the vessel.\nThe museum was well equipped with explanatory displays on survival - epic tales of courage and determination were read. The history of Convoy PQ 17 was described.\nThe work of the volunteers to keep the vessel in first class condition was very apparent and it was good to learn that members of the Sea Cadets are also playing their part in the conservation projects.\nThere is plenty to interest all family members - a recommended visit.\n\n+"},{"review":"We checked out this ship while we stayed at the Queen Mary a couple weeks ago in May 2015 and upon entering, a very nice elderly man got us prepared with our $5 tickets. I don't believe there was a map. If there was a self guided tour, we never got the info. \n\nSo off we go exploring the ship on our own. I thought there'd be plaques or labels on everything so we could learn everything about the ship as we walked through, but there were barely any. Volunteers were working in some of the rooms (so they weren't on standby to explain anything either) and at times I felt like I was intruding on their space even though most of the areas weren't blocked off for exploring. Stuff was everywhere (ropes, paddles, chairs) so you will need to watch your step, and the outside metal stairs connecting each level are steep so people afraid of heights may have a hard time going up and down between the floors.\n\nThe museum down below was where we received all the education about the ship. There were some cool and interesting exhibits, but there were also some under construction. \n\nOverall this ship didn't seem well maintained. It's good for the cost of the ticket, but that's it! It's not very memorable nor exciting. Give this ship an hour or two at most."},{"review":"While not well known, the ship is amazing. You can wander to your hearts content and learn a lot about the merchant marine ships. In addition there are volunteers that will give you some insight - just ask!\nThe ship is away from the beaten path and a bit out of the way but after an hour on it you will be happy you found it."},{"review":"We visited the SS Lane Victory in the Port of Los Angeles.

They could do a *much* better job of advertising their seats appropriately for customers who buy tickets online. We never got to select our seat, just the section. The system automatically assigned the worst seats in our section to us. Fine, if the concert was sold out. But on the day of the concert, when we knew the concert was not sold out, the staff were unwilling to switch our seats to empty seats on a different side of the same section we were in. Here's how my conversation went at the ticket booth:\n\nMe: \"Are there any available seats I can get in my same section so I can actually see the people on stage? Right now we only see the person that's right in front.\"\nRep: \"Yes, there are seats available.\"\nMe: \"Can you please switch my seats? I'm happy to pay any difference.\"\nRep: \"The new seats cost the same as yours, but you'll have to buy the new seats from scratch and forfeit your existing seats which are non-refundable.\"\n\nSo in summary, although the venue is okay from a purely technical standpoint, don't expect to get much support if you don't like the $150 seats you never got to select in the first place and then wanted to change at a show\/concert that wasn't sold out. I get the non-refundable policy, but it's inherently designed to be a detriment to buyers, and I for one am far less likely to want to check out a performer here than at other locations in Los Angeles. For a venue that bears \"Microsoft\" in its name, the unpleasant seat buying experience needs serious upgrading, as does the customer service on site."},{"review":"I visited Microsoft Theater in August, 2015. The whole area surrounding the venue is quite upscale with bright lights, neon and trendy restaurants. I felt safe because there were many people about. Please investigate parking before you come because nearby lots are expensive. Park a little further, walk, and save exorbitant rates. The theater had good acoustics and is a fairly new venue. However, be warned it resembles a giant movie theater with cement floors. I guess I expected a bit more sophisticated atmosphere. Beer, wine, sandwiches, and I think hamburgers were sold in the lobby. Beer logo signs were posted on the walls behind the drink stations. People were walking into the theater with styrofoam trays and eating at their seats. Hence, the uncarpeted, cement floors. The ambiance reminded me a bit of a sports event venue. This is a newly renovated theater, but it will not be long before food and drink stains mar the floor. There should be an eating area set up outside the theater. Two large screens are posted on either side of the auditorium, so everyone can see and hear the performance well. In summary, it is decent, clean venue, but not necessarily classy or sophisticated in atmosphere."},{"review":"Beautiful venue, Love the area the parking the employees the area where is located is a gorgeous promenade.

My 10 year old boy enjoyed it too, but he does think puppetry is cool.\nAdmittedly it is best for preschoolers and primary schoolers. \nThey serve ice cream to the whole audience after the show, which is cute, and if you ask, the puppeteers will show you some techniques.\nThey have a gift shop of course.\nNow the building is terribly run down and evidence of past glory is now well-faded and dusty. But that said, it was still a packed house. \nWarning about parking. If you an park in the lot across the street under the freeway ramp, it is free. Do that if you can. If you park in the lot adjacent to the theatre you have to pay cash. You put 3 dollars cash into an envelope and write your parking space number and license plate #on it. Then seal it and put it in the slot. (There is a kiosk where you can get the envelopes and a slot for the finished payment to be deposited. But you need to find your own pen). They do check during the show. The theatre doesn't own the parking lot. If your spot doesn't have a spot number, look to either side and count.... It is awkward."},{"review":"We oldsters like good puppet shows.

They also had marionette puppets for sale which we purchased."},{"review":"A well meaning, beloved institution for sure, but sorely in need of a cleaning.

If you enjoy \"under-the-radar\" food destinations, definitely come here and take home a few loaves of the delicious pumpkin bread. Yes, it's $9.00, but you're helping the nuns keep their cloister open. \n\nThe bread makes a great gift, and the chocolates are yummy too. It's a unique way to taste your way through Hollywood. I'm glad I went!"},{"review":"I loved the afternoon I spent at the Monastery of the Angels. It's not necessarily that close to any other tourist attractions (it's walking distance from, but not next to, Hollywood & Vine and the tail end of the Walk of Fame), in a more residential part of Hollywood where the hills and the sign are easily visible. It's actually at the end of a house-lined cul de sac, in a very quiet area that makes prayer and meditation a lot easier than it would be in most other parts of LA. There isn't much open space around the chapel and the monastery, but there are two lovely, well-maintained courtyards with beautiful religious statues and space to sit or walk around. The chapel is quiet and excellent for prayer. You may not think there's much to see if you're not interested in going there to pray, but I definitely recommend it for Catholics and people of other faiths who are looking to spend a bit of time away from busy LA to meditate.\nThe gift shop is also really nice, run by friendly Dominican nuns who know that their visitors are there for different reasons, so there are a lot of religious items, some of them the same kind of stuff you'd find in most church gift shops like prayer cards or plain rosaries, but also some nice medals, books, and handmade items. There are some nice gift items as well - their antique teacups are really cute. And then there are the sweets. Everything looks so delicious, but I only tried the pumpkin bread after reading so much about it. It's as great as they say it is. It may seem a little steep to spend $9 (yes, now it's $9) on a loaf cake, but it's completely worth the price! So unbelievably good. I should have bought a dozen of them and stuffed my suitcases."},{"review":"After reading from the different articles mentioning the difficulties that this convent was encountering, I finally took the car and went to pick up the 'Famous\" pumkin cakes.\n\nThe first time visitor of Los Angeles will enjoy the vista offered at the end of Gower street :\nthe HOLLYWOOD sign. \nThe little convent offer the best pumkin breads on thie planet.\nWell worth the detour!"},{"review":"I was psyched up to go here after reading all the reviews and the place is extremely friendly. The good news was that I was the only tourist there on a Saturday. While I am not religious and I am not Catholic, it was interesting to attend the prayer of the Rosary at 4:00 PM which they have daily. However, you cannot see the nuns pray as they are behind in the private area. You can hear them because they open a door and let you listen in. \n\nThe pumpkin bread is good, but it is $8.00 a loaf. It really was not worth it for me to go there and spend time there to buy a loaf of pumpkin bread that they make in huge batches. Just my own thoughts."},{"review":"The bread was sooooo good.

It is located on the Westwood campus of UCLA and is free. Beautiful display and fantastic collection."},{"review":"I have been to the Fowler Museum at UCLA many times and I have found at least one very interesting exhibit each time I have gone. The overall floor area is quite small, with the number of exhibits ranging from four to six. Admission is free. Exhibition durations range from a few months to \u201Congoing\u201D or \u201Cpermanent.\u201D The original name of the Fowler included the wording \u201CCultural History,\u201D and even though the name has been shortened, expect to experience culturally-related artworks which date from the latter-20th century to very recent (one exception, read below). It is very easy to walk the entire museum in an hour or less. Many exhibits are political or environmental in nature; whatever \u2026 just something I noticed after many visits.\n\nThe museum layout is a square. After you enter, pick a direction and keep following it and you\u2019ll end up back where you started. Gallery openings are on each of the four walls; there\u2019s a [lovely] courtyard in the middle. There\u2019s a pretty cool museum shop to the right just after passing the front desk.\n\nThe permanent exhibit called \u201CReflecting Culture\u201D has a couple hundred pieces of very old (16th thru 19th centuries) European silver. The quality of the collection is amazing \u2026 if you like silver. If not, walk through quickly or skip it altogether. I like the etched plates and the big sailing ship.\n\nThe ongoing exhibit called \u201CIntersections\u201D features works from UCLA\u2019s permanent collection, and highlights aspects of cultural art from five continents. I have seen this a dozen times and never get bored. Artworks include African and Oceanic masks and reliquary figures, a Mexican \u201CArbol de la muerte,\" a golden statue of Buddha and various baskets and jewelry from different cultures.\n\nCheck on-line for changing exhibits, which are featured in the other two rooms and also on the walls between galleries (seriously, the walls frequently feature exhibits of photographic or other flat artwork!). At the time of this writing, \u201CMaking Strange\u201D is very trippy, but fun, and \u201CThe Art of Hair in Africa\u201D is small, but interesting.\n\nSO YOU DON\u2019T GET LOST: Enter Parking Structure #4 from Sunset Boulevard. Go downhill into the structure, pass the kiosk on the left (whether there is someone there or not) and turn LEFT. Continue driving as far as you can get to the far wall. Park, and note your stall number. Get a paid parking ticket from one of the machines in either corner and place the ticket on your dashboard. $3 for one hour; $6 for two hours; $12 for all day. Provided you turned left after the kiosk, the nearest stairs\/elevator will get you as close as possible to the Fowler from any parking structure. When you get to campus level walk in the direction that puts the large grass field (Wilson Plaza) on your left and a long staircase to upper campus on your right (you\u2019ll be heading due north). The Fowler is 250 feet away, and there are giant banners on the building. Some of the other reviewers have missed these (see my photos), but the museum should not be hard to find provided you come from Structure #4.\n\nHungry? Ackerman Union is where the most food can be found on campus. From the Fowler, head southbound on the same walkway, in exactly the opposite direction you took from the parking structure. Keep going and you\u2019ll encounter an intersection of several walkways that start to go slightly downhill. The big building on the left, with two flights of wide staircases, is Ackerman Union. Go up the staircases and you\u2019ll find a decent food court after entering on the second floor: Panda Express, Sbarro, Wolfgang Puck, Mexican food, etc."},{"review":"We went to Fowler Museum at UCLA for the first time recently and it was wonderful. \nThey had a very interesting exhibition called, Vivan Sundaram Gagawaka + Postmortem. \nYou can see the pictures at:\nhttps:\/\/travel4foodnart.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/11\/fowler-museum-at-ucla\/"},{"review":"The Fowler Museum is not your typical museum: its focus is on cultural history, with themes as diverse as African textiles; the traditional use of auto parts in east LA to create \"muffler men\" as marketing tools; voodoo in Haiti and other Caribbean countries; and photographic exhibitions, such as the importance of water in Africa, as seen through the lens of Gil Garcetti, a former Los Angeles District Attorney, consultant to TV shows such as The Closer and Major Crimes, and an excellent photographer; and exhibitions of silver jewelry and other objects by master craftsmen in Mexico. There are both permanent and temporary exhibits, as well as family-oriented events, lectures and tours, and live entertainment at exhibition openings\n\nThe exhibits are excellently curated, admission is free at most times, and the Fowler has one of the greatest museum gift shops I've ever seen, full of authentic pieces (jewelry, textiles, decorative items, etc.).\n\nThe Fowler is located on the UCLA campus, so plan on combining your Fowler visit with a stroll through the famed Royce Hall, the Powell Library, and the Janss Steps, which offers a panoramic view of UCLA's west campus and beyond. There are ample food facilities on campus, so take a break at the Kerckhoff Coffee House or dine at one of the food facilities in Ackerman Union, both of which are located centrally on campus, or stroll down to Westwood Village for a meal and a visit to UCLA's Hammer Museum at Wilshire and Westwood Boulevards."},{"review":"... the UCLA campus around it. Fowler is quite small. One room contained a bunch of silver objects; the other had a special exhibit. Two others were closed. Not very interesting to us, anyway. Your taste may differ and you may find yourself staying a little longer than 15 minutes.\n\nThe location is not obvious, much like every other place on campus if you're not familiar with it. Download a map from ucla.edu. P4 is probably the best choice for parking. It's also very close to the Student Union building (look for the UCLA store) where there are a number of pretty good eateries to choose from.

The studio tour was a bit tired looking in my opinion but the shows such as Waterworld were amazing!! The Shrek show was great fun for all ages and abilities. We didn't think any of the food at the park was very good though. The new Harry Potter area looks like it is going to be awesome when it opens next year."},{"review":"While we've been to Universal Hollywood a few times, this time round we thought that investing in the VIP Tour might be worth the money. For this you basically get a Tour Guide who will take you to all the rides, plus a private back lot tram ride tour.\n\nFrom the beginning it was great to be able to park the car close to the gate with the included Valet parking service and know that your tickets were all sorted. It was also great to not have to worry about how to navigate the park and to avoid the lines. Your VIP Tour ensures you are the front of line at all rides and the Tour Guide does all of the park navigating for you.\n\nEspecially good was the private back lot tram ride that not only covers the same territory as the normal tram, but also allows you to get off to explore outside and inside film and TV sets. This is very much like the Warner Bros tour and really does take you behind the scenes.\n\nThe only aspect I didn't enjoy was that for the first half of the tour you are basically being dragged from one ride to another. Now this is good because you get to cover all the rides without having to think, but I felt like we spent all this time running and zig zagging across the park, which became just a blur until we stopped for lunch.\n\nAlso, while I was expecting to get interesting insights into the park, its history and how it works, for us our Tour Gude didn't really have a whole lot to say. But given we were running from ride to ride, I guess we wouldn't have been able to hear anything anyway!\n\nSo if you want all the worry to be taken out of a visit to Universal Holloywood, then the VIP Tour is worth the money. But if you want to leave the park feeling that you really soaked all the experiences of the park and explored all the nooks and cranny's then you may be better planning the day yourself."},{"review":"I took my 16 year old son to Universal for the day and we both had the time of our lives!

We were particularly impressed with the studio tour and in particular the King Kong 'experience'.\nThere are plenty of eateries but unfortunately very few places to get water - our only real gripe. \n\nActually one more - the tram (or whatever they called it) to the Metro was fine except for the neo-Nazi who took just a bit too much delight in delaying its departure."}],"streetAddress":"100 Universal City Plaza","postalCode":"91608","name":"Universal Studios Hollywood","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" 800 864 8377","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Mon - Thu","time":"10:00 am - 6:00 pm"},{"days":"Fri","time":"9:00 am - 6:00 pm"},{"days":"Sat - Sun","time":"8:00 am - 6:00 pm"}]},

One word of warning, though, the closer to Christmas you get, the more crowded it becomes. Also, if you go on a weekend your crowd will be 10 x bigger than if you try during monday through thursday. \n\nI sort of feel sorry for the residents of this community but then I realize that they all decided to decorate together so they must love it, right? You can either drive through - and because it is usually crowded you will be traveling slow enough to see everything well - or you can park and walk through. Walking is especially nice when there is music accompanying the decorations, which many have. Another attraction is that many of the more enterprising neighborhood teens put up hot cocoa stands and some even sell holiday cookies or churros. This is especially appreciated on cooler nights which can dip into the 40's. \n\nI think they leave their light displays up past Christmas day till about New Year's but I'm not sure about that. If you want to make sure to see the displays, go before 12-25. You won't be sorry and will likely make it into a family tradition as we have done. Enjoy!"},{"review":"I have visited Candy Cane Lane twice . Last year had more lights than this year in my opinion. I was somewhat disappointed this year that there was not so much Christmas lighting like I remembered from last years visit. Overall a good site to see. It's nice to walk to see all the homes. Its a plus in my book if you are not stuck in a car, in traffic, and you can take pictures near the homes. Good for little kids."},{"review":"We love to look for Christmas lights; it is one of our favorite activities to do.

Our daughter had wanted to go to Candy Cane Lane in LA for years and asked for us to take her on her birthday (we live about 2.5 hours away), so we went in Dec 2013 and were somewhat disappointed. Some of the houses were fantastic, with every inch of their property brightly lit and others were very lacking and some were just plain weird (still scratching our heads on the Quasi Moto display). If we were in the LA area around Christmastime I would drive by again but I would not make a special trip to do so."},{"review":"Our son drove us through this attraction during our recent visit, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.

The driver should not look as lots of people cross the street in the dark. be very careful if driving."},{"review":"I remember the first time I visited Candy Cane Lane 15 years ago. 99% of the house were decorated with amazing and fancy Christmas lights. It has gone down since then. I took my family this year hoping that it would surprise me again, yet it did surprise me with great disappointment. I am no expert or anywhere near it, but I could only see a few houses where I see the old glorified passion about Christmas lights. If you don't mind driving farther, Eagle Hill Kraemer and Birch in Brea is much much better where you could find a place to park and walk around for Christmas lights that are like Candy Cane Lane 15 years ago or even better because I was there last year. This place has gone down a lot and it barely hanging there."},{"review":"What a great way to celebrate the Holiday's than with a drive or walk in Candy Cane Lane. Come earlier in the month rather than later to avoid traffic and enter the back way. If you're driving, turn on off your lights and make sure your foot is on the brakes. If you're walking have a cup of hot chocolate, bundle up and snap a lot of photos of the beautiful decorations."}],"streetAddress":"Lubao Avenue and Oxnard Street","postalCode":"91367","name":"Candy Cane Lane","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" 3236142334","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

It's an opportunity to get as close as you're probably ever going to get to the real tv\/film industry.\n\nIn the fall, FIDM features the actual costumes worn in many television programs, particularly those that are nominated for Best Costume Design for the Emmys.

There are costumes from Games of Thrones, House of Cards, Downton Abbey (including the 2 wedding dresses from Season 3) and the winner of this year's Emmy: Behind the Candelabra.

This time it highlights the movies up for Best Costume Design. Check out their website at: fidmmuseum.org for exact dates.\n\nThe museum is not overwhelming: you can tour the primary exhibit and the other gallery in about an hour. And the exhibit is free.

I was dubious, there didn't seem that much more to see, but we were all thrilled that we did. The story of how Charles Lummis walked to Los Angeles from Cincinnati in 143 days in 1885 for his new job at The Los Angeles Times, interested me so much that I went to the library and got out a couple Lummis' books. \n\nFinding out that Charles not only built the combination Craftsman\/Adobe house himself, but that he built one wing of it to house his mistress while his physician wife lived in the other part...well, for heaven's sake, the story would make a great movie.\n\nI'm not a historic house person, but found every part of the house and its nooks and crannies to be fascinating.

During a visit to LA I decided to stop by his museum home, El Alisal since it was on the way to the house of some friends. I could have stayed all day. Another visitor and myself were treated to a personal tour by one of the curators, Mr vanZandweghe, for over an hour who was very knowledgable of the details of the home, of Mr Lummis' life and influence on the arts of the early 20th century in LA and of the perspective of the history of the US at the time. Mr Lummis walked across much of the US to California in the 1880s, became a champion of native American rights, popularized Spanish culture in California and was influential in the literary and artistic world of the time. Much of his collection of art and artifacts made up the nearby Southwest Museum, which, sadly, seems now to be closed. El Alisal is a lovely, artistically created mission-architecture house he designed and built much of, himself, and is almost stereotypical \"southwestern\" until one learns that Mr Lummis pretty much came up with the concept of the \"southwest\" that we take for granted, the mission style furniture and rustic architecture, and the pastel paintings of desert scenes we all are familiar with were invented by a painter in his artistic and literary circle. Much of the neighborhood in the early part of the 20th century was an artist and writer colony of the \"arroyo culture.\"\n\nThe house itself was very beautiful, with hand-carved art, stonework and woodwork and historical artifacts.\n\nI could have stayed much longer and learned more fascinating history but I had to be somewhere else. I left El Alisal with a broad perspective and much new knowledge of the creative and cultural history of Los Angeles in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and its effect on current art.

We were so high one mom got really anxious and wanted to leave. I would recommend skipping if you have to get cheap seats. Cheep seats at Pantages are much better."},{"review":"I've been to the Ahmanson Theatre for a few productions. I like the set up of the theatre and the seats in the mezzanine level are ALL great. The seats are worn on the wood edges and in the second row B you were able to see spaces between a few of them where it seems they have replaced a few of the seats but in a not so neat way. Some seats have 2 armrests because of it. But the seats are still comfortable especially for the 2 hours plus of sitting. \n\nThere's a nice courtyard with fountains and street performers singing songs. As you get closer towards the doors to the Ahmanson there are more orchestrated and professional bands outside singing. There is a place that is set up to have dinner as well. Not sure how kid friendly the menu is. There are plenty of places in the area to eat since the theatre is so centralized. \nThe Ahmanson is easy to access from the freeway as well as streets. Parking is easy and moderate cost. \n\nFor the production of Matilda it was difficult to understand the cast during the singing. I think a lot had to do with the over annunciation that the kids were doing. You didn't get lost with the story line but certainly you missed some words to the songs. Otherwise the sound here is GREAT!"}],"streetAddress":"135 North Grand Avenue","postalCode":"90012","name":"Ahmanson Theatre","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" (213) 972-7211","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Sun - Sat","time":"12:00 pm - 12:00 am"}]},

I was pretty disappointed. When we got there, we were herded into another house and had to sit and listen to an awful tour guide who spent a half an hour giving us the whole history of the family down to grandchildren. Then we went outside and stood around some more, got led into a big empty space with a pool and walls that looked like a concentration camp and got shown pictures of when it was a big beautiful green house, (why not restore it to its former glory so people really have something to see?), an hour and 10 minutes after we started we finally got to the steps of the mansion. Everyone has to put on booties, but not the tour guides. ? There is the main room, another main room, 4 small rooms and a dining room. Not much to see. They kept saying they don't USUALLY let people in some of these rooms, if that's the case you don't get to walk into any rooms except the two main rooms and the dining room. NO UPSTAIRS VIEWING AT ALL! Plus they were very militant about no picture taking. Why not? Had they at least let us do that we might have felt like we got our money's worth.

It was an amazing experience walking through this historic spot to view one of my favorite pieces of cinema. \n\nSeeing these magnificent tombs and tombstone, the lush landscape and beauty of the grounds is quite breathtaking. Considering this is a resting place for the dead, I wouldn't be so glum about death if this was where I was to go :).\n\nUnfortunately I have only been there once, for the movie and was not able to enjoy the grounds during the day but that time will come soon. Maybe during the Thanksgiving weekend?\n\nWith so many typical touristy things to do around LA, why not do something a little different and take a tour of this piece of history. \n\nHappy Traveling."},{"review":"Many famous stars and other film dignitaries are interred here and we were intrigued by some of the unique headstones and epitaphs. But the grounds were unkept and in need of a maintenance overhaul. Still worth a look but don't expect Forest Lawn."},{"review":"Make sure you wear some good walking shoes and be prepared to be amazed! To walk in the place where famous people have been laid to rest is quite the experience, and to be able to see all the unique headstones of \"not so famous\" people is just as exciting! Walking through the cemetery and seeing the of the headstones of the dearly departed allows your imagination to work overtime. You will see a man sitting in a chair, or the face of the loved one who had passed, a unique sculpture, the statue of someone, a bench with a view of the pond, or even the pyramid that is not yet occupied. There is just so much to see. If you take the time to walk the cemetery, there is even older plots along the back wall of the cemetery, which is also the back wall of Paramount Studios. Take the time to read some of the headstones. Take time to sit at the Holocaust Memorial or at the Anne Frank Memorial and say a prayer for all the lives that were lost during the Holocaust. It was a wonderful experience to see the final resting places of Rudolph Valentino, Bugsy Siegel, Iron Eyes Cody and so many more. This is definitely a place where you will want to spend a good deal of time. The cemetery is full of history. Your first stop should definitely be at the Flower\/Gift shop as the lady who works there is very well informed about the cemetery and can give you great insight into who is buried there and where. I would suggest at at least 3-4 hours to walk through the cemetery and remember to bring your camera! You never know what you will be able to photograph there, including the beautiful peacocks that roam the grounds and the coi fish in the pond."},{"review":"Have always wanted to visit the celebrity cemeteries of LA.\nPrior to our weeks trip to the city I did all the research, downloaded the guides from the seeing-stars website (invaluable)\n\nWe were however somewhat shocked and disappointed by the neglected grounds. Most of the graves are semi covered with grass. -Forest lawn with it's acres of grounds ensure that each and every grave stone is manicured. (we visited both Forest Lawns and Westwood so could compare fairly)\nA perfect example of this is the Fairbanks tomb, this should be beautifully trimmed lawns and clean waters as it deserves instead of murky green water and overgrown grass- such a shame. There must have been so much money invested initially laying these Hollywood Greats to rest -glad they can't see it now.\n\nSo whilst it was great to finally 'meet' the celebrities (and there are lots) this cemetery sadly seems currently not to be worthy custodians. This together with a very busy feel (cars, staff) seemed to us like a lack of respect. Visit the beautiful, tranquil Forest Lawn, Glendale and you will understand our comparison.\nEven now a week later writing this I'm still very saddened."},{"review":"Last movie I saw at the cemetery was Willy Wonka back in July but every time I've been here it's been a great experience. Giving it 4 stars instead of 5 just because parking is always a little tricky if you\u2019re going to a Cinespia screening even though it\u2019s probably not an issue if you go during the day when (I think) you can just drive on. If you want to hear some great stories about the cemetery and its \u201Cinhabitants\u201D definitely check out Paramount\u2019s new After Dark tour \u201CTales from the Other Side\u201D!!! A little pricey but my husband and I loved it."},{"review":"The lady in the flower shop was very informative and helpful. The grounds needed some TLC. Didn't feel very safe. Not a very safe area of town."},{"review":"A cemetery isn't really a place you would think of as an \"attraction\", but Forever Hollywood Cemetery is not only beautiful, peaceful, but you can visit the graves of your favorite Hollywood stars. You can spend hours walking around and seeing all the beautiful tributes to the stars. A highlight for me, being a Wizard of Oz fan, was the tribute statue to \"Terry\" the carin terrier who played \"Toto\" in the movie. There is a lake, swans, and beautiful mausoleums to walk through."},{"review":"Very interesting cemetery, with a lot of celebrities buried here. It is just adjacent (along its rear boundary) to the old Paramount Pictures studio lot. An interesting grave to visit is that of Nelson Riddle, the musical legend who wrote (among other tunes) the old \"Route 66\" theme. The theme plays continuously at the grave. Ironically, Santa Monica Blvd (the street out front of the cemetery) is an old section of the original Route 66."},{"review":"This is not something that sounds fun but my friend and I had a good time, looking for the legends and finding them.

It is a very nice place."},{"review":"although i've been to Los Angeles many times, my first visit to Hollywood Forever didn't occur until recently. it's 64 acres of lush greenery, and serves as the final resting place for many stars of yesteryear. they also hold film screenings and concerts from time to time. the area of Santa Monica Blvd where it's located is a little run down, but seems safe enough as i saw families and young professionals going about their daily routines (the cemetery is open during normal business hours, so this is best for a daytime activity). best advice is to go when the weather is a little cooler: i was in L.A. during the late-September heat wave, so i only stayed on the grounds for a short amount of time as temperatures were in the 90's. parking is free (if you tell the staff you're visiting the grounds, they'll tell you where to park), and there is a public restroom. bring a camera, bottled water, and good walking shoes!"}],"streetAddress":"6000 Santa Monica Blvd","postalCode":"90038","name":"Hollywood Forever Cemetery","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" 323-469-1181","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Sun - Sat","time":"8:30 am - 5:00 pm"}]},

I really didn't have a plan but I knew I wanted to see something. So I looked up land marks on my trusty smartphone and presto the chandelier tree was only 2 miles away. Well I'm going to see this I said. I don't have a clue as to what it is, but I will find out! I drove to where the chandelier tree and found it was on a side street off Los Feliz. It was on the corner of a dead end side street. I went up the street turned around came back and parked in the red zone right next to the chandelier tree. It was interesting a big sycamore tree with lots and lots of chandeliers gracing the branches. As it was daytime so the chandeliers weren't lit up just yet. The is a little parking meter in front of the tree. It is an ornate parking meter for sure. The parking meter said donations. I'm sure this guy is using the donations to pay for his electricity so I dropped a few coins immediately. Wow what an interesting idea! Well as I looked up and and there was a man sitting on the porch he said howdy I said howdy and we chatted a little. Yes it was his house his name was Adam Tenenbaum. He put the tree up about 7 years ago and it's been a local hit. We chatted about some other things and he said well in about 20 minutes I'll turn it on turn on the lights for you.\n\nWithout asking, Adam went in and turned on the lights.\n\n I took a few more pictures I thanked him, and went on my way. Have you seen it the chandelier tree? if you live in Los Angeles and you are in the area come by in the evening and see it when its lit."},{"review":"Driving through the tree isn't that appealing for an adult, however it was still something to do that's different, and kids just think it's so awesome.

We even enjoyed a butterfly pavilion, (still there till early September of this year, by the way,) outside of the rose acreage. My elderly Mom dearly loves butterflies, and was captivated by all the different varieties neither of us had ever seen before the sunny day we visited this site. Lovely day and area! Highly recommended!"},{"review":"The Science Centre & Natural History Museum are must see attractions at this great Los Angeles Park - especially for those with young children.\n\nHighlights include the Space Shuttle Endeavor & lots of dinosaurs.\n\nWe spent almost a full day exploring these two institutions with our ten yr old.

We wandered the market and looked at everything from flowers that were almost dead and intended to be used as scattered petals to beautiful, vibrant orchids. One vendor had a sign up forbidding photos, but the others assured us that this was the exception. No one else cared. Because it was our anniversary, my husband bought me a dozen roses."},{"review":"So my niece was in town and wanted to see something she could not find in her small town. We decided to go to the flower market on a Saturday. We parked in the structure which cost $4. On Saturday there is also a farmers market on the street between the buildings, so the street is blocked off. One building was free to walk through and the second one charged $1 per person. We all enjoyed the selection of flowers, succulents, vases and other things that you would need to make an arrangement. Although we did not intend to buy anything at first, the prices and selection were too much to resist! My niece really loved it and I think I should come here more often. The only reason I give this four stars out of 5 is that the market is not fancy, just a true no frills market and they have only morning hours so do not go too late or many of the vendors will be closing up."},{"review":"Really nice place to visit if you like flowers. To glam up your hotelroom, or just as gifts, you'll find everything here!"},{"review":"We lived near the flower district so we thought we would check this out. If you are looking for flowers for any occasion this is the spot to come. The flower district is several blocks long and has nothing but flowers to offer you. I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood and seeing all the shops."},{"review":"This was one of my favorite things to do while visiting LA. The flower mart is in a warehouse in downtown LA, and is a unique experience that lacks the usual touristy crowds at other LA attractions. I have never seen so many flowers for sale in my life, all at bargain basement prices. It was so interesting to see people buying them in quantity for their own weddings; apparently, people working on movie sets purchase their flowers here as well. A really authentic place of great beauty....I highly recommend it!"},{"review":"After a very early arrival in LA we decided to check out the flower district. This place is open from 08-12 each day for us commoners and actually opens at 0200 for the florists and those in the trade. 2 dollars in admission and incredible selection and prices throughout. This place is 2 floors of flowers on both side of the street and 2 hours is just not enough time. Honestly we spent what we had planned to but we left with more flowers than we ever imagined. Everything was beautiful and there was so much to choose from, we just decided to go crazy with it and filled our hotel room. We had a lot of fun with it and really turned it into an unforgettable experience.\nFlowers aren't the only thing here, you can buy vases and arrangement supplies if that's your thing but the flowers were the unforgettable thing. Surprise your wife with $100 worth of flowers and she'll never forget it.\nThe next 2-3 blocks to the west are the garment district so if you want fabric to go with it they have everything there as well."},{"review":"Unless there's a funeral, I usually don't think about flowers very much. But I do have a warm memory of the Flower Market. The Market cheered me up at a time when I badly needed a lift. It was my first time in L.A. I'd arrived on a Greyhound bus in the wee hours. No city looks good at four a.m., but Los Angeles was making a particularly bad first impression. This was many years ago, back when the bus depot was located in an old office building near skid row. Half the vagrants in L.A. seemed to be drifting aimlessly in and out of the station lobby. Some poor psychotic derelict was there, engaged in a life-or-death brawl with a gang of imaginary assailants. Leering winos ambled past. Near the doors a guy was lying face-down on the floor, not moving. Out on the street, I suddenly sensed that I was being followed. I turned and saw a police car inching along the curb behind me. The cop in the passenger seat had a face just like a Mayan carving, and he was giving me a long, hard stare. You know you're in a tough place when even the police scare you. I didn't know anything about the geography of L.A. at the time and I wandered into the industrial area east of the central business district. The streets were dark, deserted and depressing. But just then I walked past the open doorway of the Flower Market. Joseph Mitchell, the writer, would go down to the Fulton Fish Market when he was having a bad night. The activity in the market would cheer him up. The Flower Market had the same effect on me. The place was a little oasis of purpose and order in a dark sea of anomie and chaos."},{"review":"LOVE this place! Admission is $2 ($1 on Saturdays) and go early! Everything goes fast!\n\nMy mom is awesome at flower arranging. So she made the centerpiece, boutonnieres, and bouquets for both my wedding and my sister's wedding.\n\nThere are so many vendors there. Seriously where else can you get 2 dozen ROSES for $12!?!? Or a huge bouquet of flowers for $10??\n\nIf you find a vendor you like, call them before you go down! One time my mom went and found so many roses in the color she needed. Then we came again the following weekend and he only had 3 dozen of that color we needed. We bought ALL of them and some poor woman after us wanted that same color.. HAHAH sorry lady - we bought all of them."},{"review":"Decided this was going to be part of my Downtown LA experience-my husband opted out of this. I grabbed a coffee and asked my hotel desk about walking to the Flower Mart. They suggested I cab it down there due to so many homeless being on the street, It was 6:30 am as I headed down 7th Street. I decided to walk down as far as I could go and would turn around if it started feeling dicey. There were homeless on the street but tragically they were still asleep on their cardboard and niches. Most of the people on the street at that time were those catching the bus for work.. And to be honest, it was still a little uncomfortable but I forged ahead after thinking about turning around a couple of times.\n\nWhen I arrived it was a visual and scent experience. I'm more of a live plant person, but it was still spectacular to see all different kinds of flowers. It had every kind of cut flower that one has seen in floral arrangements and others I had never seen. It is several large warehouses that are cool in temperature and emit a sweet flower scent. I enjoy succulents and found 2 areas that sold them for a good price. I purchased 9 small ones that the proprieter put in a box for me. There are also areas to buy vases and other floral items.\n\nAs I headed back up 7th Street with my box of succulents, there were now many, many homeless on the street. I didn't feel necessarily unsafe but my hotel was 0.8 miles and when I saw a bus I hopped on. The bus driver commented on my box of succulents and we had a very nice conversation about his garden and plants all the way down 7th Street. At Hope Street I got off and handed him one of my succulents. I enjoyed the Flower Mart with all the sights and scents but sometimes it's not only the attraction that makes travel fascinating, but the people you meet along the way."},{"review":"This place is a trip through flower heaven. Prices are AMAZING and there is every type of flower possible. Also plants, orchids, etc. I have purchased HUGE bouquets of roses with star gazer lily in the middle, lovely greenery and babies breath. Cost --$15. It can be broken up into two or three large size bouquets in vases at home. Go early, wear walking shoes as it's enormous and be prepared for a visual, sensory and amazing low cost experience of a lifetime. EVERYONE should go at least once.

We were able to get close enough to some of the most beautiful cars in order to see inside them, and the curators opened the doors and hoods on some so that we could get a closer look. The musical instruments, from music boxes to sophisticated orchestrions surpassed anything I\u2019ve seen elsewhere, and the opportunity to see and hear them in action was a magical and moving experience.\n\nSo what\u2019s my problem? It was the mediocre tour experience. The tour is free and, as a result, a large number of people want to attend, and the management seems to have trouble saying \u201CEnough.\u201D There were far too many people on the tour, making it difficult to access some of the cars while the tourists needed to have pictures of themselves taken with the members of the collection. Also, due to the size of the crowd, most people didn\u2019t listen or follow instructions very well. I was amazed at how rude some of the crowd was. Despite the curators repeated requests not to touch the cars, I had to scold one idiot myself because he leaned his cane up against the painted bodywork of a beautiful Pierce-Arrow so he could take a photo of his wife! As a result, the curator spent much of her time acting as a shrill and annoying commandant. Once she had finished with her pre-packaged spiels it was difficult to get her to answer questions because she was too preoccupied with keeping the group corralled and moving according to her schedule. Other docents were similarly distracted and inaccessible.\n\nMy wife and I departed with mixed emotions. We visit a lot of similar museums were frustrated with how aggravating and annoying the visiting experience was, and how it detracted so much from our ability to enjoy the collection.

By this what you need to do is first view on \"You Tube\" a comedy short filmed by the Hal Roach Studios (of Keystone Kops Fame) with Laurel and Hardy who received the 1932 Academy Award for the same category. (Yup they actually won an academy award...who knew?...I sure didn't and I'm a fan!) You have to put yourself in the frame of mind of that era nearly 100 years ago during the \"Great Depression\". People needed to laugh then as we do now because of the sad state of the economy. Let me tell you if you don't laugh at this short clean humor of the time then I'm one to tell you that you don't have a funny bone in your body. I believe there was another movie shooting years earlier in 1927. It was shot at this very same spot and then it was again in a updated version in the 40's with a different item for delivery. (you'll know of what I speak after you watch the video) At any rate this place is a sacred place in Silverlake for true Laurel and Hardy Fans. In fact I actually believe they have a little annual Laurel and hardy Celebration here every year at the small park at the base of these famous steps. When you get here and are on these steps you really can feel these two world famous comedians prescence and you get a good impression of what \"being on location\" really means. One thing you will find doing is comparing how the area looked then in the 30's and how it looks now. Check out the plaque that notes about what happened here. (Too bad some people with no class at all vandalized it a little...they had nothing better to do but to show their stupidity and lack of respect and education) I found it interesting about the homes on the side of the steps...where do they park their cars? These steps have also been used by the LAPD for their Cadets as a tortureous part of their morning runs from their academy in Elysian Park...(what killer that would be to run up after an already long run and then you had to run back approx 2 miles back!) Anyway check this place out. It is a true Angelino Treasure. After checking it out drive down to Chinatown, Koreatown, Filipinotown (around The Original Tommy's Burgers), Thaitown, Olvera Street (get a massage), Little Ethiopia, or Little Armenia and scarf up some exotic food. It's all good! Enjoy the adventure in Silverlake. This place is so full of rich Southern Califonia History."},{"review":"What can i say? It is an honour to visit these iconic steps. Take some old stills from the film with you and you can recognise all the points. It is obviously a bit more built up since the film but mostly the same. Not too tricky to find. We also visited the house where A Perfect Day was filmed and it has hardly changed. We also payed our respects at both Stan and Olivers' graves."}],"streetAddress":"923 - 935 Vendome Street","name":"Music Box Steps","rating":"4.5","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This review is just for the Anne Frank exhibit. First of all it was moving and inspirational because it was Anne Frank's story and words. It would be hard not to be moved by it. However the exhibit was a disappointment to us. The exhibit was almost entirely audio\/video with reproduced artifacts and pictures. Also it was very controlling. You have to move from one section to the next with the audio. When one of my younger kids move ahead before he should have we were reminded by staff that this is not how it works. It is more of a scripted tour\/movie experience than anything else and for the price we paid it was a huge disappointment. We could have just watched a documentary and looked at some pictures online and had the same experience. I also found the staff somewhat disconnected, they did not seem to enjoy being there at all. The security guard at the parking area was awesome though."},{"review":"In some ways, Anne Frank was the original blogger. This exhibit highlights her letters to cousins pre-hiding and then brings her diaries to life with family photos and memorabilia of the time. The timing is a bit rushed - would be better if guests could control the audio. We also toured near a volunteer who was giving a tour to another guest - it was a bit distracting to hear the audio and him talking at the same time. That said - I highly recommend it!"},{"review":"I would have given this a 5 star, but it was a bit confusing how to get a personal child card at the beginning. Otherwise, the Holocaust part of the tour was very informative, with good pacing throughout, and not too overwhelming with detail. The heart-wrenching stories and graphic videos\/pictures might be too overwhelming for young children, however. The highlight was listening to the amazing story of Jean Greenstein, a 91-year-old survivor who miraculously survived the Nazis, the Hungarians, the Russians, and all that time posing as a German soldier and working for the underground to save fellow Jews from Auschwitz. His 93-year-old sister was also present. She had survived concentration camps, and both of them were reunited in Romania. Sadly, their parents and siblings did not survive. The tolerance section of the museum was all right, but it almost seemed like an after thought. The upstairs immigration section, although intended to be contemporary, is outdated. In order to draw more young people who probably did not know Joe Torre, Billy Crystal, or Carlos Santana, more recent immigrants might help. The idea of portraying home life in an artistic and personal way, however, works. My wife said the Museum of Tolerance was much better than the Holocaust Museum in D.C."},{"review":"Excellent museum of the Holocast. Not an easy thing to witness let alone review, but very well done and poignant."},{"review":"The Museum of Tolerance does convey the horrific information about the Holocaust. This is important to share. There's no denying that. However, we had a very disappointing experience. First, visitors must be aware that this is NOT a museum where you will be allowed to explore at your pace and take in what you wish. You will be controlled and directed. We were VERY put off by the aggressiveness of the first employee (Kenya) we encountered. She was stern in her tone and not welcoming at all. We wanted to linger for a moment to see the Simon Wiesenthal information, but were told \"no\" and directed to the start of the exhibit. Once in, the automatic doors open and then close behind you. You are in darkness and must listen to the recorded options that take you through. It's all very scripted. The unfortunate part is that some of the audio from one side of the exhibit leaks into your area as well. So you get distracted listening to what you're hearing and then the next portion. (Plus, there was a crying baby in the group before us...in the closed space, that echoed.) You see some images and are moved along to the next section. We did not like this at all. We were also disappointed with how much emphasis is on the Jewish experience. While it's very important, everything else seems to be a secondary issue. Little is said about Darfur, Armenia or other genocide. It's there, but literally gets a sentence or two. You get the feeling that it's bad, but there's no in-depth information. Further, modern day issues such as Matthew Shepard are addressed, but the situation gets about three paragraphs on the wall and nothing more. Videos show events such as the Selma to Montgomery March and school integration, but there is nothing nearby to explain it. If you aren't familiar with what you are looking at (or even who the major players are that are shown throughout), you are NOT going to learn from this video. There are not captions and nothing to provide insight. As you leave, there is a VERY cheesy futuristic (pseudo Star Trek) looking room where you can sit to be quizzed on events. It's all fine and well, but we had to wait for the looping video to restart and then the scoring screens didn't work. As we exited, we noticed the guy at the welcome desk just sitting with his iPad playing video games. In the gift shop, where we hoped to find books that we could read on various topics, we instead encountered a CD player blasting Bob Seger's \"Night Moves\" and the attendant singing along. Hmmm...not exactly the respectful atmosphere I expected while looking at information about Anne Frank and pondering a purchase of \"Night and Fog.\" Finally, I think there is great opportunity lost here. If we're to make a difference, as this museum seems to stress, there is no information about WHAT would work and why. There is nothing that offers ideas or concepts on moving forward in a powerful way. We left, still stung by Kenya's attitude from the start, and then more of an emptiness because so much bad can happen in this world...but what can be done to make it better? We were first time visitors. I will not go again and do not recommend this venue. You do not get your money's worth."},{"review":"This place an eye opener and very well put together. I love museums and this one was a great place to come to. Sad and intriguing to hear the history of the all who was lost and the end result of the Holocaust. The tour guides get personal and lead you on a small tour and lecture, then you are with a small group taking a guided automated tour. I would highly recommend visiting this place. My only regret was not staying longer and listening to speaker about their experiences."},{"review":"Museum is excellent.\n\nMoving and an important reminder of the Holocaust.\n\nPleased to see many young people present."},{"review":"We went on a Thursday night and got a private tour of the Anne Frank exhibit!

Even if you don\u2019t, it\u2019s still surprisingly good and, if you are near this area, it would be a real shame not to sample it. \n\nBarely an \u201CAttraction\u201D in the normal sense and not exactly a Park either! \u201CClutters Park\u201D is a widened side walk with a few benches and small tables, situated on East Imperial Avenue at Sheldon St. Street. Parking is free and usually not a problem.\nIt is commonly known to the old-timers as Imperial Hill, though it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll find that name on a map. It\u2019s USP (Unique Selling Point) is that it\u2019s the highest viewing area close to LAX Airport. If you want to watch non-stop planes in and out of Los Angeles, this is absolutely THE place to do it. Even non-plane lovers seem to enjoy a relaxing 20 minutes panoramic view of non-stop air-traffic at one of the world\u2019s busiest airports. Bring a picnic!\n\nIf you want to stay a little longer but your companions don't, send them 250 yards east, along E Imperial to El Segundo Doggy Park, another little niche \u201Cattraction\u201D in this area! This too can be fun. After that, you can all go visit the Flight Path Learning Center & Museum, just another quarter mile East, then left down the little hill of California St, then left (West) on Imperial Highway and then next right into the airport area, again on California St.\n\nIf any of this, including the doggies, is of the slightest interest, you can easily spend a half, or even a full day in this area, for absolutely free. On that basis, it\u2019s hard to fault and it gets 5 stars from me though it\u2019s obviously not everyone\u2019s cup of tea."},{"review":"Questo punto di osservazione ( più che un parco) permette di vedere il volo di una parte dei aeroplani che atterrano a Los Angeles.\n\nStandard , se proprio non avete nulla da fare."},{"review":"有名な飛行機撮影ポイントです。公園と言っても、歩道が少し広くなってベンチとテーブルが数台置いてある程度です。Runway 07R\/25L, 07L\/25Rが目の前で、終日ほぼ順光です。Runway25Rからの離陸機をきれいに撮ることができます。"},{"review":"アメリカで飛行機を眺めるだけの場所って多くは無いと思いますが、ここはそれができます。\nLAX名所のアーチ型レストランと管制塔が航空機と一緒に写る写真が撮れます。\n車で行く場合は、GPSでは出て来ないケースがあるので、その場合は東に５００ｍほどのエンバシーツイーツホテルが目印です。\n小高い丘の上のアメリカ国旗があります。公園と言っても、歩道に椅子とテーブルを置いただけの場所\nですが、ゆっくり過ごしている人が多いです。周りはエルセグンドの住宅街で何もないので、飲食物は買って行けばいいと思います。"},{"review":"Addicted to aviation photography, you will find there among the best spot on earth for aviation photography.

The closer that you get to Venice Beach, however, you will encounter lots of walkers crossing back and forth across the bike path, as well as sand on the trail which can be dangerous. As an example, people were standing along the path waiting to cross over when my sister in front of me slid out with her bike on the slippery sand, and I narrowly avoided crashing into her, and the crowd of people by coming to a sliding sideways stop.

There are lots of places to eat along the way, on the adjacent streets, especially in Santa Monica, Venice, Playa del Rey and in the South Bay. I'd recommend taking along a picnic lunch. Fun things to look for: surfers, seals, pelicans, sailboats with spinnakers, jumbo jets taking off overhead, crew teams rowing, outrigger canoes, seagull opening mussels by dropping them on the trail, skaters, and all manners of tricked out bikes.

The refinery is in El Segundo so the beach access is limited, this is where you can have the entire place to yourself. Ride a bit more and you go around the marina (follow the signs) and into Venice. Oh, I love Venice Beach!! I can spend hours watching the skaters dance at the skate park or the guys at Muscle Beach showing off. This Beach is a treat for your senses. Get something to eat here then onward to Santa Monica. So beautiful! Then look back at how far you have to ride home. Round trip is about 42 miles, the pavement is marked so you know how far you've ridden. Work your way up to the 42!!

That is very much absent in the Bay Area so we appreciate it all the more. It was also interesting to find the Atwater Village neighborhood and I'll have to learn more about that.

I enjoyed the exhibits and the Indian Market they had the weekend I went. They are the only place in the LA area to host one of that caliber and it was top notch! Can't wait to go back!"},{"review":"I visited the Autry museum on a private tour with my childrens' private school. In our group there were 19 children and we broke them up into groups of 3 or 4 students with a chaperone that was either a parent or a teacher. Our children are in fourth grade and are extremely well-behaved. I have twin boys and was put in charge of my two and two of their best friends. We were assigned a docent named Mike. All the other docents were just lovely -- there was one woman named Judy who had been a fourth grade teacher and couldn't have been nicer. But unfortunately, we were assigned to an autocratic, highly unpleasant and new docent on some sort of a power trip. As we entered the museum Mike looked at me and said: \"You will stay at the back and not speak. Only I will interact with the boys.\" Are you kidding me? Who does this person think he is? The boys' mouths were open. Since I am not shy -- and since my children were involved, I told him I would do no such thing. My regret is that I didn't complain immediately and demand another docent. But since we were with my sons' school, I remained quiet. Inside the museum, Mike tried to engage the kids. But it was clear he had no idea what fourth graders know or don't know. His language was inappropriate and he refused to let them see what they wanted to see. He was, again I use the word \"autocratic\" and determined to be \"in charge\" of their tour. There was no going with the flow. I saw that the four boys were chafing and wanted to know certain things. Since I am the room parent in charge of one of the boys' class and extremely involved in the school, I also happen to know what they are studying -- and the tour was the culmination of their study of the State of California. Mike kept referring to \"the West\". Politely I said to him: \"Sir, would you mind to please explain what \"the West\" means in context of the map of the United States? The kids simply didn't know. He answered me thus: \"You are to be quiet. I don't want to hear anything out of you!\" The four boys were shocked. They looked at me with shocked eyes and open mouths. One boy -- my friend's son -- said to me, \"He is so mean!\" Mike refused to let the boys see the exhibition of badges. He also gave them misinformation and stated facts that were incorrect. Several times as he was expounding, I read the captions on the exhibits -- and in more than one instance saw that what he was saying was different than what the museum had put in writing. He kept asking one of my sons questions -- and my son kept pulling away from him. I told my son to pay attention and answer please. But then I realized why my son kept pulling away: the docent had horrendous hygiene and my son couldn't take it. The man was pushy, rude and disrespectful. How dare a person who is guiding schoolchildren aggressively try to embarrass and shame the student's or students' mother? The docent had no idea who the boys were, that two were brothers, and certainly did not have any idea or sensitivity to their level of knowledge or their interests. Nor did he care. His sole interest was to regurgitate his canned shpiel. Had I been the nastiest, most inappropriate mother on the planet -- it would still be unacceptable for a museum \"tour guide\" to point that out to that mother's children. Afterwards, I complained to another docent -- I was told that this Mike was new. Frankly I am simply horrified. Quite frankly, he was -- to put it politely -- unpleasant from the start. How he passed the museum's muster, I frankly cannot imagine. We entrust our children to people like this to help in their education -- and the school paid for the privilege of visiting here. The Gene Autry Museum completely failed us; it is incumbent upon the museum to vet their employees and\/or volunteers -- especially if they will be interacting with children. No child should have his parent rebuked or embarrassed in his or her presence. I feel that my children, their friends and I am owed an apology. And until and unless said apology is received -- I will notify my childrens' school that this study tour is inappropriate for future classes."},{"review":"The Autry museum is a terrific place that has been well planned and displays some of the finest historical western artifacts ever. The location is midway between downtown and the San Fernando valley and offers plenty of parking.

They are very active supporter of the Native Arts. I have been to Pow Wows here (outside) and joined my Screen Actors Guild \"Native American Caucus\" for original plays in their theater. So they are active in the community and the staff is nice. I always want to support organizations that support community, especially when I get to enjoy works of art in the process.\n\nThe kids will like the \"Treasure Hunt\" forms available at the entrance. And when they find the works of art and check them off, they get a \"passport\" stamped and a free gift. There are different places to put on western wear including the Greenscreen where they can ride a horse on camera through a stampede and other fun through the magic of video. It's in the same section where the grandparents can see memorabilia from their youth, such as the Lone Ranger Costume.\n\nI liked the Totem Poles, the sculptures, and especially the real deal artifacts like the historic guns, gambling tools, stage coach, fire wagon, bicycle and photographs. \n\nAnd I loved the 1948 \"Indian Chief - Roadmaster\" (because you cant tell the \"Story of the West\" without a big motorcycle!)\n\nI'm a sucker for museum gift shops. Mostly because they have stuff that is hard or impossible to find elsewhere, Like the Observatory and JPL have meteorite jewelry; the Autry has Native jewelry of Silver and Turquoise, and other themed gifts and books etc.. One can visit the gift shop without even going through the museum. There is a separate entrance right out front. So if you find yourself at the zoo or hanging out in Griffith Park, know that it is there for your shopping and\/or browsing enjoyment.\n\nThe entrance to the Autry faces the entrance to the L.A. Zoo and it is possible to do both in the same day, depending on your style (of visiting museums) and your stamina. \n\nFREE to the public on the second Tuesday of every month - Closed Mondays.\n\nAdults: $10 - Students (with current ID) and Seniors (60+): $6 - Children (3\u201312): $4 - Children under 3: Free - Free entrance with current ID for active military personnel and veterans, peace officers, and park rangers.

We stopped by and ate at The Farmer's Market, shopped at The Grove for a bit, then headed over to get in line for the show. It was easy for us to get tickets. You have to wait in a couple of different lines for a bit, but all the staff are nice and efficient. They've got the process down to an art and let you know what will happen before you go to the next line. They do confiscate your cell phone before you enter the studio, but rest assured you will get it back once the taping is over. We also got to see some Price is Right props while working out way towards Craig's studio (which added another little bit of fun to the experience)! \n\nCraig was hilarious, personable, foul mouthed, and went off script-and we loved every minute of it.

Best wishes to all of you now and in the future."},{"review":"As someone from the UK i've always admired how Craig found success in America and eventually became the successor to The Late Late Show and i knew that if i ever made it to LA this show would definitely be something i had to come and see. This summer i booked a trip and got tickets for the September 1st show and i couldn't be more excited. I've been to numerous tapings of The Tonight Show and Late Night with both Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon but Craig's style of hosting is something that can't be easily replicated by anyone else. As other reviewers have said, the wait is long and isn't the most pleasant in the heat but chatting to other people in the line who were from Europe made it more enjoyable and the 1iota staff were lovely and handed out umbrellas for the duration of the wait. Once you're all checked in and security checked you'll be directed to benches in the shade where there is a little shop where you can have a bathroom break and buy some merchandise so you can get a snake mug! After this the taping flies by and you'll be out before you know it so enjoy it! The audience warm up guy was hilarious and greeted everyone as we went in to be seated. One of the best parts of the taping was the audiences inside joke with Craig that he made references to throughout the show. I'm just so glad i got to see the show before Craig sadly leaves next month, i'll miss him hosting greatly. if you get the chance to visit before it ends, do it!"},{"review":"I am so glad I took the time to do this while I was in LA. Yes there is a bit of time spent waiting before the show but it was well worth the wait. Craig Ferguson is hilarious and it was good to be able to see him live before he finishes up this year."},{"review":"My son and I have been Craig Ferguson fans for quite awhile now, so while we were in LA, I thought I'd take him to a taping of The Late, Late Show for his birthday. \n\nWhat everyone else says on here is true. You wait on the sidewalk for a long time in the hot sun. The 1iota folks will pass out umbrellas to make the wait more bearable, but bring some water. That being said, it wasn't a miserable wait.\n\nWe went to the Farmer's Market behind CBS around 12:30 and had a nice leisurely lunch. Our \"line-up\" time was 2:30, but the instructions said to be in line by 2pm. We wandered around for a bit, and finally decided to head on over a bit earlier than 2pm. I'm glad we did; there was already a line of around 50 or so people.\n\nYou are shuffled around from spot to spot, but I thought the process actually went pretty smoothly. And it's well worth it when you get into the studio and get to see the show! They were taping two shows (and Craig made a few jokes about it during the taping,) which was very cool.\n\nCraig was hilarious and very interactive with the audience both while the cameras were rolling and off. And the rest of the crew was great, friendly, and very professional.\n\nAll in all, I'm very glad we got to see the show live, especially since Craig is leaving in December. And my son said he had a great time!"},{"review":"Always wanted to be a part of a studio audience and thrilled that my first time was for Craig's show. Been a fan for years and it was a delight."},{"review":"We have been watching the show on and off and planned our trip around attending a taping. Due to transport issues we arrived 5min after the specified arrival time on our ticket. After waiting for more than an hour we were told because we were late we weren't going to get in. They made it seem like it was all our fault for not getting in but the tickets do state they over subscribe because some people don't turn up. So if everyone who gets priority tickets turns up 30-45min beforehand not everyone will get in. Anyway, they said we could come back the next day and they would let us in because we were turned away the day before. So we did, and got in. I was called up on stage during the warmup (must have been the Aussie accent) and won a free t-shirt. It was fun to watch how the show is taped - it is actually taped out of order - and it was fun to see some real life celebrities! I agree with a lot of the tips on here - bring water, wear something sensible, prepare for the wait - you may meet some interesting people in line - and get there early! It is pretty good value considering it is free! The show ends in December so if you want to go, get in soon!"},{"review":"I went with my husband. We had a great time! (He even got a free t-shirt from warm-up comedian Bob O'Shack!) Here are some things to keep in mind: \n\n-- Everyone who signs up on the 1iota website gets free \"Priority\" tickets but the word \"Priority\" means nada. Everyone waits in the same line. My husband kept wondering where the priority line was (this is not like the airport) and we asked a 1iota staff member. It seems they get this question a lot. \n\n-- You can park at The Grove which is right up the street from CBS studios. We turned where we saw the Farmer's Market sign. Also, there are a few places to grab a bite and drink, like Chipotle, Blaze Pizza, Veggie Grill, etc. \n\n-- You will wait in line outside for awhile. We were in line for about 30 minutes and were in the middle of the line. Sunscreen is a must! My feet were burning in sandals due to the hot sun and trying (and failing) to keep the umbrella at an awkward angle to shade them.\n\n-- You will be offered an umbrella from a 1iota crew member. It's also a good idea to bring a drink with you while you're waiting. They offer bottles of water (not cold though) after you've gone through security.\n\n-- Don't bring your cell phone or camera with you unless you want to hand it over to security and wait in line after the show to retrieve it. There was a pretty long line that we breezed past because we left our phones in the car.\n\n-- You can bring a small purse. Security will search it. Another lady there said she thought that you can't bring a purse, but you can as long as it's small.\n\n-- You will wait (about 1 hour) on benches outside, then stand in line inside the building, then sit in the actual studio waiting for the show to begin. You will only be able to use the bathroom once before entering the building and they will let you know when it's your final chance (until the show is over, of course). \n\n-- Plan on being here at least 4 hours. My husband and I arrived at 2:15 PM and left after 6 PM.\n\n-- You may be hot outside standing on the sidewalk, but it's cold inside the studio! I recommend bringing a scarf. I took it off when I was outside and put on when I was inside the studio.\n\nWarm-up guy Bob O'Shack pulled 3 people from the audience and talked to them on stage and gave them free t-shirts and my husband was one of them. So you may have the chance to win a shirt. Just be prepared to clap and laugh as it's your \"job\" to belly laugh a lot! \n\nI recommend going to this show because it's a great experience, free, and it's FUN! This is Craig Ferguson's final few months so go while you can. You will be experiencing part of TV history."},{"review":"As many of you know @TyraBanks started a new TV show called the @FABLifeShow which is currently taping shows in Los Angeles. \nI have never been to a live show taping before, but when my friend told me Tyra was doing a baby shower episode on FAB life and wanted all pregnant women in her audience, I thought it would be a fun thing to check out since I'm currently 8 months pregnant. The show hinted that they probably would have some great gifts for the mommies-to-be. Who doesn\u2019t like some free baby stuff? Remember that Mother\u2019s day @TheEllenShow where the audience went home with all those amazing gifts?! Who wouldn\u2019t want to be on a show like that??? So I followed the instructions to get tickets to the show and a few days later I received my \"priority tickets.\u201D I was excited and anxiously awaited the day of the taping! Few days prior to the date, I received two follow up emails from the show. The first email suggested that there would be gifts on the show, \"so we advise that you MAAAYBE come prepared with lots of space in your car.\u201D The second email came with my ticket info and stated that if I didn't plan to show up, to decline my ticket so that it could be given to someone on their waiting list. \nNowhere in these emails was it ever mentioned that there would be a chance that I would NOT be getting into the show! I planned on having space in my car, coming in with my ticket and arriving early. I was going to be ready for a show! \n\nFollowing the instructions, I showed up at 10AM. Priority check in was from 10:00-10:30. Their emails stated that if I arrived after 10:30 I would lose my priority status and might not make it in with general admission. I wanted to make sure that would not happen. \n\nThe show also stated not to bring any water or food because it would not be allowed in. So although I am 8 months pregnant and hungry all the time, I didn't bring any food. I assumed that since general admission was at 10:30 that the whole audience of pregnant women would not have to wait around long and they would probably offer at least water once we were inside. I was wrong! \nWhen I arrived at 10 there was already a long line. It turned out, that besides the priority list and general tickets, there was a \u201Chouse guest list\u201D for friends of the show. Soon someone came out and tried to find people from the line who were on that list and shuffled them inside. But, I still assumed that all priority ticket holders were going to be allowed entrance. \n\nAfter AN ENTIRE HOUR of standing, they made all the general admission people leave because too many people showed up from the \u201Chouse list\u201D and there were no more seats. They picked out about 12 of us from the priority list (me included) to stay and the rest were let go. AFTER ANOTHER HOUR PAST, more \"house guests\" arrived and as each arrived they cut our group more and more. In the end, only 3 priority ticket holders were let in and after standing in line on swelling pregnant legs, with no food or water for 2 hours, I was told to go home. \n\nThe employees at Tyra acted as if any ticket holders who were not on the \u201C house list\u201D were like cockroaches to them. No, I'm wrong. Actually, general admission ticket holders were dirt, priority ticket holders were like cockroaches. \nI feel extremely disappointed and mislead! Nowhere in my many emails from the show did they ever mention that I might not be let in. If I knew that there was even chance that I would not be allowed to enter on the day of the show I never would have signed up. This was harsh treatment for any guest! But to make pregnant woman stand for two hours, in the sun, with swelling legs, with no food or water, is a major health risk. The least they could have done was bring us some water and offer us a seat. \nI reached out to the person who invited me from production and she apologized fo the miscommunications and invited me for a future taping which I will not attend. Someone from the ticketing company also reached out and blamed everything on their disclaimer saying that tickets are not guaranteed. Naturally, there is a tiny disclaimer hidden at the bottom of the tickets that I did not read. Of course they hide that language so you will neglect to look for it, therefore assuring that they fill their audience seats while screwing you over at the same time. \n\nSomeone might think if a show goes out of its way to an audience full of pregnant ladies, they would at least have the decency to treat them with some respect. Not so FAB treatment at all."}],"streetAddress":"6565 Sunset Blvd Suite 517","name":"The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" (323) 570-0059","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

{"reviews":[{"review":"It was one of those hot days in Los Angeles. The type of day that the soles of your shoes could melt on the hot sidewalk. But there was an oasis just up the road. A place to refresh the body and revive the soul. Barnsdale Art Park.\n\nThe Barnsdale Art Park is located on a small hill with great views of the Hollywood Hills and all the way to the ocean. On the top fo the hill there is a visitor center, an art museum, a large area with nice, big shade trees, and Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House. The Hollyhock House is an exceptional house with a design that you won't see in the tract housing that has sprung up throughout the southland. It is a building that was designed to expand your sense of well-being. One cannot find the words or the correct sentence structure to describe this house, so all I will say is that if you have an intrest in architecture, design, or just beauty, you should visit Barnsdale Art Park and the Hollyhock House."},{"review":"Somehow, after being a resident of LA for over 37 years, I missed this hidden treasure. This is a very tranquil and beautiful place. The main attraction is the home created by the famed architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, for a very wealthy socialite and philanthropist (Google Barnsdall Park). The home is still being restored. There are other venues on the expansive grounds, including a small but fascinating museum. The views are pretty grand as well."},{"review":"We came here to see an art exhibit and were quite surprised at Barnsdall Park. It was refreshing to see such a beautiful and hidden place amid such chaos as Hollywood. To get to it, you have to drive up a steep winding road to the top of a large hill that seems out of place with all of its' trees and foliage. Once up top, you can park in any of the parking spaces that line the edge of the road. Parking is free. The park occupies the entire hilltop and features nice grassy lawns, the L.A. Municipal Art Gallery, a children's art school and a number of other buildings. The views of the Hollywood Hills and downtown L.A. are breathtaking on clear days. The park has a number of bathrooms available. The locals come up here to have picnics and just relax, so get here at a decent time in order to get a parking spot. The park can get crowded, so be prepared for little to no parking sometimes. This is due to only a limited amount of parking spaces available around the hill road. Up near the art gallery, there is no grass under the shaded building structure. The park provides maps of the grounds and historical facts via info displays around the park. The day we came here to see the gallery presentation, It was the birthday celebration of Ms. Barnsdall who donated the land to create such a nice park. The artist we came to see, ceremoniously cut the cake. It was a fun time. I recommend a visit to this park if you are in the area, because it is a rare thing to see such a tranquil and bucolic setting in the midst of such congested urban confines. It's worth a look."},{"review":"Barnsdall Park has a lot to offer to the local patron as well as to the interested tourist. We went to see the most recent art exhibit because a friend had been awarded \"Best of Show\". We were impressed, not only with her interactive installation, but with the variety of work displayed throughout the gallery. The exhibit is free and the docents are very eager to share information about the current artists as well as future displays. It's a lovely setting on a hill-top in the heart of the city with magnificent views, including the famous Hollywood sign and the historic Griffith Park Observatory. We ran out of time, so we will have to return to tour Frank Lloyd Wright's Hollyhock House."},{"review":"The Frank Lloyd Wright house is finally open to the public and it was an informative tour. The docents are all up on their architecture."},{"review":"This is a beautiful park in between sunset blvd and Hollywood blvd just behind by kaiser and CHLA, a perfect place to stroll up the hill while waiting for my mom's surgery.

There are many homeless though and mostly quite place."},{"review":"Great place to relax, magic views towards Griffith Observatory and park, and the hills of Hollywood. The history of the Frank LLoyd Wright designed house is interesting. A great place that seems mainly to be the preserve of locals relaxing and enjoying a quiet, lovely space."},{"review":"Barnsdall Art Park is a hilltop oasis in a very busy part of Hollywood. It has beautiful grounds, as well as the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery (LAMAG). Visited the gallery recently to see the Doris Duke Shangri La travelling exibit. The Shangri La exhibit was fantastic. It will be leaving LAMAG soon and returning to Hawaii where it will open at the Honolulu Museum of Art in February. The gallery is very supportive of local and emerging artists. The park and gallery are well worth a visit."},{"review":"Located in East Hollywood and a short drive from Griffith Park and Los Feliz, this is a gem of a space located on top of a hill with stunning views, including spectacular views of the Griffith observatory. The building from Frank Lloyd Wright is amazing, the grounds are so beautiful and peaceful. And parking is free!\nIf this was not enough, there is also an awesome farmer's market on Wednesdays. It is small but cute and definitely not crowded or loud. Not all of the stuff is organic, but it still worth a stop. You can get some delicious food and have it up hill while enjoying the amazing views, The amaranth tortilla chips were to die for and so were the vegan treats!

Always alive with pedestrians and traffic there was an almost small town \"buzz.\" There were the few \"fancier\" boutiques and expensive designer stores mixed in for interest. Now almost all of the little shops have been either abandoned or replaced by expensive names like Alexander McQueen (ahem) and whoever has that Pepto Pink building near Crescent Heights and of course the \"anchor\" of the avenue Fred Segal (restaurant and clothing store? hmmm never did get that one)...but I digress. If you still wish to tour, shop, dine or otherwise check out the Melrose strip be sure to bring lots of $$$ unless of course you plan on window shopping and wasting an hour or so waiting in line at Pink's hot dog stand.

Starting on the West side, it becomes apparent that this is real high end shopping at it's best. There are some very big names along this strip and this continues for quite some way. You'll need to save megabucks if you want to shop up big in this area. But it's quite a beautiful stretch of road to see all the designer digs and homewares.\nAn absolute must for lunch is Crossroads Restaurant, just on the corner of Sweetzer Avenue. It's a beautiful restaurant that is ripe for celebrity spotting, not to mention a beautiful meal.\nAs you begin heading eastbound, the shops start to take on an interesting twist. What was once high end fashionist heaven, soon becomes funky, unique boutique shops. You will get some magnificent original pieces once you get past Fairfax Avenue.\nThere are your big brands like American Apparel and Urban Outfitters, but be sure to check out American Vintage and Sportie LA for some really cool finds.\nJohnny Rockets, the original hamburger joint, is along this strip and you'll be sure to find loads of really cool retro vintage thrift shops and bohemian boutiques the further along you go.\nIf you make it all the way along, head to Larchmont Boulevard and turn south, just off the corner is Cafe Gratitude which is a beautiful place to rest your feet and get a healthy, wholesome meal in a vibrant and peaceful setting.\nMelrose Avenue definitely has something for everyone is is far more affordable than Rodeo Drive. It's a fabulous place to find a bargain, but also to do some really unique boutique-style shopping without all that mass-produced stuff you find in all the chain stores.

Still, along a great part of the river, there are also some well-kept bike paths(near Griffith Park and the Autry Museum) and if riding, being careful not to watch the wildlife TOO closely and risking a collision with others on the path or like my wife did once, a fence post, it can be good cheap entertainment with exercise to boot!

Once you arrive, the hike is very nice too. It is not too difficult and I saw some families with kids at the Eagle Rock. The trail to Eagle Rock is only 2.2 miles but be prepared to spend at least 1.5 hours for each way. As others have remarked, the view from Eagle Rock is breathtaking and you have to experience it. I took some pictures but it does not even come close to describing my experience.\n\nTips: Take a bottle of water. I had a large bottle and finished it all. And there are no restrooms once you depart the parking lot. Even more important. There is a $10 parking fee that you have to enclose in an envelope (available on site). Make sure that you have a $10 bill with you and a pen. They do accept personal checks. There is free parking on the street outside in case you do not have money which is fine since you are going to hike anyway.

The views are amazing and the trails weren't too challenging. California is in a drought though, so there wasn't any water to see. Creeks were pretty empty. We didn't bother to try the waterfall trail since we figured it was probably dried up anyway. \n\nOnly downside is you have to pay $10 for parking and it's through some weird envelope system, meaning you'd have to have exact change or a check on you (being that it was our first visit, we had no idea). Luckily we had a bunch of 1 dollar coins that we got from a vending machine earlier that morning.

A bit of scrambling on the way down but nothing too difficult. You read a lot about whether this is a \"real\" hike and the kinds of people and fashion you see on the trail. My advice is ignore all of that. Enjoy the exercise and the views. Take water though, there's none on the trail itself.

It is difficult to say if you like it or not but it is surely one of the most original religious design we have seen in America."},{"review":"The Cathedral is built not only as a monument for the Catholic community of Los Angeles, but for all peoples as the cornerstone relates quoting the Old Testament Prophet Isaiah. It is inspiring to see how a world famous architect interprets the classical cathedrals of Europe for the 21st Century. The building suggests in the asymmetrical shaping of the walls that the transcendent is beyond the scope of human geometry. The variations in light that flood through the Alabaster windows also suggest the multiple and variable characteristics of the Divinity."},{"review":"Very modern architecture.

It is truly a site to behold. Relying on the basic architectural shapes and colors of the Spanish missions, the new Cathedral (12 years old) soars above the street level entrances with a modern architectural flair that is amazing to see outside and in. Every detail of the inside steals from tradition and transforms the church into a 21st Century house of worship that for this century equals the beauty of the great gothic cathedrals. Special note goes to the paintings on the side walls that tell the story of the Church in the new world to the present. Even pictures do not capture the beauty and grandeur of this architectural gem. Why LA hides it,. I don't know. It is a block from Disney Hall and with the other modern public buildings on this multi-block \"square\" its worth many hours to visit."},{"review":"You don't have to be Catholic to enjoy this beautiful Cathedral- the architecture, peacefulness, piety, serenity, and beauty makes this a must see everyday- not just Sundays"},{"review":"When my mother was in town from Chicago, I took her to see the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.

As it turned out, the artist who created the angels at the base of the alter of the Cathedral was on the tour with us! She told us that the angels she created were made from gold bullion and that the alter itself is the world's largest ruby. When we first pulled up to the Cathedral the first thing we all seen was the beautiful \"floating\" Madonna with the golden halo. Please look closely at her, because she is definitely unique, as she was modeled after a Native American, Mexican and African girl, wearing Jewish clothing. As we walked into the magnificent Cathedral I noticed the extremely large, beautifully carved doors. As everyone else just walked past these beautiful doors, I took the time to really look at them and discovered that each door tells a story. Walking into the Cathedral, past the vestibule into the main part of the church I had seen the huge pipes for the pipe organ! Oh my, do they make wonderful music, and we were fortunate enough to have an organist give us a 20 minute concert! That was a wonderful and unexpected treat! Come in, sit down, look around and listen. The large window behind the alter looks like stained glass, but it's not! It's alabaster! And when the sun comes through this window, it is indescribable. Look closely at the alter, it may look like red granite, but as I stated, the artist to us that it is a very large ruby. This ruby was carved in, and shipped from, Turkey and was donated to the church. Be sure to check out each of the light scones by the alter because each one is unique! And when you are sitting looking in the church, you may notice things others miss. Just as I noticed a naturally formed cross in the marble that no one else noticed until I pointed it out to them. When you are done looking around inside the church, walk the courtyard. You may be lucky enough to hear the bells, which had such an amazing and haunting sound to them. You can even check out the gift shop and maybe find yourself a little something.

We selected this zoo becuase of its high rating. Unfortunatly, it's way below our expectations. We have been to many zoos, but this is one of less than avarge. You need to search for the animals in their cages to see them. The over all housekeeping is low. Some of the animals seem sick. The worst is the route inside the zoo. It is a maze.

I would not go again and I do not recommend it."},{"review":"We were a little bit disappointed with our visit. The zoo looks old fashioned and some of the houses dirty and not in good shape.

I don't know how they picked Dockweiler except that it does have several appropriately sized fire pits, and it does seem like a nice, clean beach compared to a lot of other beaches in the LA area. I thought the paved bike path look swept and safe. There was plenty of parking on a May Friday evening for watching the sunset and eating s'mores. The parking was just a few dollars collected in cash, on this particular day. Otherwise there is another parking lot up past the RV parking that takes credit cards for a little more than $10.\nThere is a great overview of all the amenities at all the LA beaches at: http:\/\/beaches.lacounty.gov\/wps\/portal\/dbh\/beaches\/\nYou just click on the one you're interested in.\n\nDespite the amenities, I would never pick this beach for an activity where it was important to have a pleasant conversation with people. Every minute we were there, another jet launched out of LAX, right over our heads, and all conversations had to stop until the noise was low enough to be heard-over. Maybe some people don't mind it, but my idea of a good time is backpacking where the only human noise is me."},{"review":"This beach can get crowded on the summer weekend but now it's perfect.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This house in really interesting in so many ways. In historical context it's an early international style modern home built with many utopian and socialistic ideals and has an interesting family history. On a practical level it's an uninhabitable concept house that is interesting in its own right but something I found pretty awful for its design. There's a lot to learn all around."},{"review":"Tucked amongst the bungalows and small apartment buildings of West Hollywood is Schindler House, reportedly the first modern house in California. If you manage your expectations, you will enjoy the experience of visiting this quiet escape in LA. It is a small property and rooms are very sparsely furnished. It would appear that the foundation does not have extensive funds to keep it up, as evidenced by water damage in several places...the modest $7 admission fee notwithstanding. Still, it is a wonderful example of early modernism and the play between interior and exterior spaces. Guests can take a self-guided tour of the several rooms and go up a small staircase to obtain a view of the garden. An interesting visit and retreat."},{"review":"Be careful of their home tours. You pay a pretty stiff fee for a home tour that on the website says begins at 11am and will take about 3.5 hours. You then get your tickets in the mail on the Friday afternoon before the tour that says you can't start your tour until 2pm which is too late for you because you work evenings. You scour the website to make sure you didn't miss something but there's nothing that says your tour may start three hours later than the posted starting time. You then try to call the Center to ask them if you can start earlier and there's no answer. You are forced to miss the tour because you can't begin that late. You call Monday to offer feedback that they should make the timing clearer on the website and end up talking to an extremely rude and arrogant young man... When we had to skip the tour we decided to not push for a refund and instead consider the ticket cost a donation to the Center because we appreciate the work they do. However, the attitude of the man who answered the phone ensured that this will the last donation we ever make to Mak."},{"review":"The Schindler house is widely considered to be the first modern house. The flow of space and unique uses of spatial arrangement, finish materials, lighting and intersecting lines are incredibly fascinating. The house is 90 years old and looks like it could have been built yesterday, instead of in the height of the Colonial Revival and Bungalow era. The house and grounds are very clean and well maintained, but the house is mostly unfurnished as it is used as an exhibit space by the MAK Center for Art and Architecture. The lack of furnishings is rather disappointing as it makes it more difficult to envision the space in use by the Schindler family, but this is understandable. The employees at the ticket office\/book shop are knowledgable and friendly, and are willing to offer advice on their fabulous book selection. Parking is free and on the street and admission is a bargain at $7 for an adult."},{"review":"Simply put, this is one of the most revolutionary houses ever built. The spareness and simplicity of the building is amazing: it's often described as half-tent, half-house. Schindler rethought what it means to live, and to live in relationships with others, and designed a building that proposes an entirely new way to exist, both independently and interdependently. There are no velvet ropes and tedious tour guides here: you move through the spaces of the house and its room-like patios and gardens on your own, which allows you to imagine what living in this incredible place might be like. Friendly staff at the ticket office know tons about the building and will gladly answer questions. Visiting the Schindler House was by far the most astonishing place I've visited in Los Angeles. It's so subtle, so humble, and full of lessons for sustainable building."},{"review":"We were very excited to visit Schindler House after seeing the website. We're a big fan of Frank Lloyd Wright and modern architecture and what a cool thing to see, one of the most modern, historic homes in the city. At $7 per person, we were expecting a lot. Well . . .there's not much to see. You enter into the maze of the house. The kitchen was loaded with \"stuff\" (bags, glasses) like someone messy lived there. The bathrooms appeared to be, umm, working. Then, the rest of the house was just empty and filled with cobwebs with an art installation sprinkled throughout. We explored the garden a bit, but it was kind of strange and eerie. I guess I was expecting either a furnished house or a completely pristine empty house. This seemed dirty and abandoned. I would not have bothered paying $14 if I had know what there was to see. There are plenty of other houses in the city and Pasadena that are worth a look."},{"review":"My partner and I (in our 40s) dropped in at the Schindler House and it is such a unique - and easy stop - that it really adds a bit of extra flavour and dimension to an L.A. trip.\n\nI'm the one with architectural training, but you don't need it to appreciate the uniqueness of this house (even today yet!), as my partner can attest. She thought it was so cool.\n\nIt was something like only $7 per adult to get in and get a free tour (about 45 minutes). The docent was excellent and it really added to the appreciation.\n\nIf in the Hollywood area it is highly recommended for a quick visit. And it can be: parking is easy, it's just off the beaten track (e.g. 5 minutes drive from the Farmer's Market), and it's not overly large, relatively (but big in ideas and experience).\n\nTruly takes you to another place and truly worth your time to learn and see :)\n\nENJOY!\nGlobalTime"}],"streetAddress":"835 N.

We ended up in the Downtown Historic District. It was pretty smelly and not very clean and there were many beggars on the street.

Honestly there is not much more to say - you will spend an hour getting there to see nothing.

Once one goes through the gates into the park, all the nonsense of the world is left behind. Some of my most loved ones are residents so my main goal is to visit them. I find peace and calmness whenever I visit as I spend the majority of my time in the masauleum. It is quiet and I am left alone with my thoughts and my tears.

Nice shops, and restaurants. Safe place to walk, specially for families. \nInstead of bar hooping I did a food hooping !!! I started in Kula (to the left in the main street), it was a belf with different kind of sushi and sashimi (raw fish), every plate at 2.25$ ... then I got fresh sushi at Nijiya Market (let me tell you something, you know that fish has to be eaten fresh, if the Japanese people get trays and trays of food in front of you, you can not be wrong).

Wind chimes, sculptures, and Sakura lanterns, etc.."},{"review":"We came for lunch, in search of the definitive, authentic ramen bowl. We found it (at Manichi)...and so much more. This is one of the epicenters of the Japanese-American experience, complete with a world-class museum, two monuments (one to the Space Shuttle, the other to WW2 Congressional Medal honorees), multiple Buddhist temples, two Japanese gardens, excellent restaurants, and charming shops. It's a great way to see part of the \"real\" LA away from the beach in the heart of downtown.\n\nIf you go for lunch and shopping, this is a two hour visit.

A conveyor belt sushi restaurant is in Japanese Village Plaza, near 2nd street. Try the mochi ice cream shop in the plaza.\n\nThe neighborhood is changing. Besides Japanese food, I stop by the Subway sandwich shop on 2nd and Starbucks on Central. Mr. Pizza on 1st has Korean style pizza. Yogurtland is on Central. Korean food is available in the Little Tokyo Galleria at 3rd and Alameda.\n\n For Japanese souvenirs, I recommend going to Daiso in the Little Tokyo Galleria, at 3rd and Alameda St. Most items are around $1.50. \n\nThe best time to experience Japanese culture is during Nisei week in August and New Year's activities in January.\n\nAlso tucked away in Little Tokyo are a couple nice gardens. One is at the Doubletree Hotel at Los Angeles and 2nd St. Another garden is located at the Japanese American Culture & Community Center, at San Pedro and Azusa St.\n\nFor visitors, Little Tokyo is a nice stop on the way to another activity.

A little over 200 yds long, bounded by very high fences. But the best thing is they use balls that are in very good condition. That really sets it apart from most of the area ranges that have balls so old and scuffed they almost have no dimples left. Sun at your back in am, hitting into the sun in late afternoon-sundown. Good lighting for evenings. Last buckets sold at 10pm, close at 11pm.\nPutting Green - Pretty good practice green, closed on, I think, Tues and Friday. Can be pretty crowded.\n9 hole Exec Course - a very nice 9 hole course with holes from about 80-120 yds. Real greens and bunkers.

I don't know if I can properly express how awful of an experience I had going here. When we first arrived we decided to hit some balls on the range first, so I reserved us a spot while my friends went to get some balls and clubs. I stood there for about 15 minutes wondering why they weren't back yet, and a few minutes later they returned. My assumption was that there must have been a long line, but that was not the case. According to them they spent 15 minutes being yelled at by the awful woman behind the counter for no reason. I figured they were exaggerating the situation and that they must have done something to cause this woman to yell at them. \n\nThey told me that I needed to go get clubs from her, because she wouldn't let them get clubs for me without me being present. I went in figuring as long as I was polite there would be no reason for the woman to be mean to me or treat me the way my friends claim they were treated.\n\nSo I walked in with a smile on my face and said\n\n \"Hi, my friends told me I needed to get clubs here, they said I was on a list\" \nto which she goes\n \"nobody left you any clubs here!\"\n\nI was shocked this woman instantly started yelling at me. So I say \"Sorry, that's not what I meant, I need to rent clubs\". I don't recall exactly what she said next but she didn't seem to want to give me clubs, so I said \"if there's a problem I don't need any clubs I can just borrow theirs.\" She responds with \"You can't use their clubs!\"\n\nShe then reaches for clubs and asks what I need. She starts naming off clubs, so I say, \"I don't know a ton about golf, so just give me what you think i'll need\", which was the worst thing I could have possibly said. She yells \"Do you even know how to play golf!\" I was speechless. I felt like anything I said was just going to make her angrier. I am no golf pro, but I did take a golf course one semester in college so I understand the basics, but never learned much of anything on the different type of clubs. While I could have asked for the clubs that I thought were right, I figured it best for her to decide what I needed since its her job and she would probably know what I needed better than I did. \n\nShe yelled once again \"Do you know how to play golf!?! Luckily a customer behind me just yelled out what clubs to take. So I said \"can I please have those clubs\" but she still kept yelling \"do you even know how to play golf?\"So I just repeated \"can you please give me the clubs\", which eventually wore her down and she gave me the clubs. \n\nTo top it all off we had to wait like an hour and a half to actually play and once we got on the course we had to wait like 10 minutes at each hole. \n\nTo anyone who actually read all of this i'm sure you think i'm just exaggerating things and that this couldn't possibly be that bad. I understand that, I would think the same thing, actually I did think the same thing when my friends told me what happened to them, but I can assure you the experience was that bad. \n\nIf the owner of this establishment happens to look at this the woman I am referring to was an older woman, probably in her 50's or 60's who was working on 06\/17\/12 around 3pm. You need to fire her, because if this is how she treats customers you can be sure that you are loosing customers from her attitude alone."}],"streetAddress":"4141 Whitsett Ave. at Moore Park","postalCode":"91604","name":"Studio City Golf and Tennis","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" 818-769-5263","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Sun - Sat","time":"7:00 am - 10:00 pm"}]},

Wright designed his hollyhock which is featured in many places in the home in various iterations - stone, wood (chairs). Wright then went off to do the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Japan, and Aline Barnsdall got fed up with the house not getting finished. The house was begun in 1915 but not finished until 1921. Del, our guide, was terrific and could give us so much information because she has been involved with the \"not for profit\" group for many years. Don't miss this great site with beautiful views."},{"review":"The history behind this Frank Lloyd Wright home is very interesting. The setting is beautiful. I would also encourage any visitors to stop in the Los Angeles Municpal Art Gallery which is right on the same property."},{"review":"We were fortunate enough to visit on a day when the house is open to the public. Incredibly beautiful, well kept and with great comments from the volunteer guides on the spot. Highly recommended attraction in LA !"},{"review":"The Skinny: \n\nParking: free paved lot at bottom and up top\nPrice: $7 - credit card only\nTime: less than 30min\nNote: no photographs\n\nI was very excited to see the restored Frank Lloyd Wright house in Barnsdall Art Park. The parking lot was full when we got there but it was for a croquet event that was happening there. They had a docent led tour at 1115am but we chose to not do that and go in and see the house. When you go up the ramp to the entrance they stop you to put booties on to protect the floors and carpet. Heads up, they reuse the booties for other guests so the later you get there.... They give you a speech: no food, no drinks, no photographs, no touching the walls. When you step in, there are docents in the three areas of the house that you can see. It takes about 20minutes to look at these three areas because there is no access to 2\/3 of the house which was kind of a shock and very disappointing. They should only charge $3 for what you can see. What you do see is pretty amazing from an architecture stand point."},{"review":"My sister and I have visited a lot of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings, so when I saw the Hollyhock House in L.A. was available for tours I was very excited. My husband and I came here our first night in L.A. for a wine tasting. Unfortunately, I waited too long to book the tour (available during the wine tasting and on certain days) so we only got to see the outside and what you could see from the outside of inside the house. My advice is if you want to tour this, don't wait to book the trip. There were food trucks set up to eat outside (3), and inside a certain area, we got a wrist band, two wine glasses and were able to sample 4 or 5 wines. Since we got there a little late, there wasn't much spots left to sit. People come early with blankets and food and set up there area. It was still nice to see what we could of this house, built for a client who later fired FLW, but the downside (for 2 adults on vacation) was there was a TON of kids running around. I guess the parents needed some adult time, but these adults needed some kid-free time, and this wasn't the place to find it. The wine tasting, with a DJ spinning tunes, seemed like a very local thing to do. With the Hollywood sign in the background and a beautiful sunset, we felt like we were really in L.A."},{"review":"... while the walking tour in the rooms open to the public is worth the trip, too much of the house is either not restored or restored for special purpose use. An observant visitor however can get a sense of the house's original design, but a before\/after video in the garage or a decent set of pre-restoration pictures would greatly enhance the experience. It is sad to know how much of the original setting is gone or about to go (guest house), a visual reminder of the challenges in saving our architectural history."},{"review":"It is a beautiful piece of art, and to see it is such a treat. The grounds are run down, which is disappointing, so don't expect more than the beauty of eyeing this classic piece of architecture."},{"review":"It was a treat to see a FLW designed home from almost 100 years ago. His attention to detail was amazing. You must wear foot coverings (provided) and you can only look into the dining room, music and living rooms and library. The docents provide the history of the different rooms of the house. There is also a written explanation of the rooms.\nThe owner, Aline Barnsdall, also created an Arts Park on the property and was a very independent woman. There is a great history on the website.\n\nThe location of the house is atop a hill and the view is of the Hollywood sign and the Griffith Observatory.\n\nA very enjoyable afternoon!"},{"review":"If you like FLW, you have to check it out. Even though he got fired (for cost overruns... Surprise) the place was finished and then restored to his standards. You get to see a portion of the house, and nothing upstairs at this point. The living room to perfect. Dinning room as well. The docents were very knowledgeable and very interested in discussion and passed along great information. Outside, the space is bounded by a chain linked fence.... Limits the full feeling of what the outside feels like. Guess the area at night is not the best. Worth the $7.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"We had booked (via our travel agent) our rental to be picked up at Hertz LAX depot. We had flown 12hrs when we landed at LAX at 1pm on a Fri afternoon in late September and got picked up from the terminal quickly by the bus (probably waiting less than 5 mins) but as soon as we arrived at the depot, things turned bad.\n\nThere were 26 counters available but only 6 were open, the line was the slowest moving I've ever been in, there was no air-con (or at least it wasn't noticeable) and not a lot of seating for people lucky\/unlucky not to be in the queue. What was just as infuriating as the lack of open counters was the amount of Hertz staff strolling around behind the counters not actually working when there was a huge queue.\n\nWe finally got served after waiting an hour in line, I complained and asked for an upgrade due to the horrendous service and the lady kindly agreed and offered me a 'free' upgrade for an extra $10\/day (which was just part of their standard up-selling)- what part of free didn't she understand??\n\nWhen we left the counters, the line was so bad I would expect the people after us would have had to wait at least 2.5 hours!!\n\nTo add insult to injury, there were only 2 exit booths open with a huge back-log of cars, which then took another 30 mins to get out!! So we spent nearly 2 hours at Hertz LAX - great start to the vacation!!\n\nHertz LAX sort your sh1t out!! There is no way we will use Hertz again or recommend them and we have recommended to our travel agent that they do not book Hertz LAX for future bookings for their clients."},{"review":"If you rent a car from Hertz make sure you have gold (free to sign up, make sure you sign up at least a week in advance) to avoid a long unnecessary line when you arrive. (Your car will be ready when you arrive and you just go get in it). Shuttle bus from LAX came in a timely manner and the staff was helpful. The car itself was clean and no issues. No unexpected charges to our card. \n\nWhat was a huge disappointment for me was that Hertz needs to warn its customers about the toll system in California. It is absolutely ridiculous. When you go through the toll, all it gives you is a website to go to within 5 days... there is no option to pay at the toll. There are no markings to identify the toll plaza itself, and no prices listed anywhere. When we attempted to go to this website, it asked specifics like which toll plaza we entered, the date & EXACT TIME we got on the road and off the road... of course we did not have any idea, as this was a couple days later. (Nowhere on the highways does it tell you that you will need this information). We called the toll company and they would not give us any information just based on the license plate, citing \"privacy reasons\". We then received a letter from Hertz a couple weeks later for $30 \"administrative charge\" and spent an hour on the phone & online with \"Toll Roads\" trying to figure out how to pay the tolls. They claim that they will charge you a late fee of $60 PER MISSED TOLL if you don't pay within 5 days, and when you call they do not even give you information about how many tolls you went through. They basically give you no choice but to wait until you receive a violation notice. \n\nI feel all of this stress with tolls could have been avoided if Hertz customer service were kind enough to tell us to write down the exact location and times that we went through each toll booth. Maybe this may be common sense to people from the area, but we have never seen anything like it. \n\nAnother thing to watch out for - I did not personally experience this with my rental, but I noticed while waiting in line that every time a young female\/females would come in and ask about rentals, the staff would try to push expensive luxury cars and extra fees on them. Seemed very sexist to me, perhaps it was just the one staff member."},{"review":"Be very wary when using these sharks.\nAs someone who has rented a car in the USA in excess of 20 times I can say that these people are awful.\nOn collecting my car from the LAX office I went through the usual booking process and was told, as usual, that they would hold my credit card details in case I returned the vehicle with less than a full tank of fuel..\nOn return to the depot I called in the gas station not 100 yards away from the rental station and filled the tank to the brim.\nThey then charged me nearly $55 facility charge for returning the car full and not empty as I should have done, apparently.\nAfter 3 different people I eventually argued my case that I had not agreed to return the car empty but full as I always do.\nI would guess that any visitor less savvy with this type of practice they would charge for whatever they can get away with.\nI usually rent from Alamo with no such problems but thought I'd try Dollar on this occasion. Mistake on my par that nearly cost me. \nAvoid these people like the plague I suggest."},{"review":"At the end of our US trip, we stayed 4 days in LA. For those 4 days, I wanted to drive my dream muscle car, a Dodge Challenger R\/T so our travel agent reserved one through Hertz via their Adrenalin collection. \nWe arrived at LAX and handed the assistant the voucher from the agency expecting to pick up our fully fuelled and prepared Challenger and take it for a drive up the coast. After all, their own site does say \"Reserve this exact model\" next to the picture of the car. The assistant (Andrew I think) looked at the voucher and then asked what car did we want and we already knew this was a problem. We told him it had to be a Challenger, nothing else. He looked on his system and then said, great news, one has just come in and is ready. However because it was a speciality model, wouldn't hand it over until we upgraded our insurance. We protested that the voucher would cover this but he disagreed so we had no option but to pay $82.\n\nWe got the keys, found the silver Challenger in its bay and I immediately noticed the lack of badging or stripes and plain wheels. I opened the bonnet and immediately spotted the problem. We were given the SE model, a base spec V6. The R\/T is a V8 which is in the Adrenalin collection, the SE V6 is not.\n\nWe went back inside and told Andrew, he'd given us the wrong car as it was a V6 and not a V8 and he didn't really seemed to understand the difference. It became clear that there was no challengers R\/Ts there or nearby for me to rent and I'd have to choose something else. Disappointing but I had no choice. I simply said it had to be a V8, I'm not settling for anything less that what I was promised. Mustangs were suggested but these 2 were V6s. In the end, he found a Camaro SS convertible which I said I'd take. However, because the way the Hertz Adrenalin classes are designed, it's not in the same class because all cars are in their own class. Because of this I was to be charged $90 a day to \"upgrade\" to what I would see as a similar class of car. After speaking to his supervisor, Andrew got this down to $45 a day. How generous of them! At this stage we had been in the Hertz office for over an hour and I just wanted to get on with our holiday.\n\nThe car itself was fine, although someone previous to us had been smoking in it and it stunk. It was a V8 and it was nice to drive but it wasn't the challenger I wanted and I was charged $212 to \"upgrade\" when I shouldn't have had to.\n\nTo anyone thinking of renting through the Adrenalin or Prestige collections at Hertz, DON'T! If I hadn't have had the agency voucher I would have shopped around at other rental outlets or found a speciality hire instead for my dream car. Hertz disappointed us in the end of what was up to that point a wonderful holiday in the US. I'll never rent from these novices again."},{"review":"Great rental. I used to travel a lot for business and was even a president's five star member at one time. However this time takes the cake. We received a new car maybe only 1800 miles on it, clean and ready when we walked out the terminal. However that is the norm for gold members. The surprise was when we returned. The team leader looks at us when we get start getting our luggage out and calls out to one of the co-workers. He says Beverly will take you to the terminal. Then he starts to load the luggage back up. We get in the car and within three or four blocks. We are friends with Beverly and she is talking baseball, grandsons and how she enjoys her job. She takes us right to the gate. Helps us unload, wishes us a safe trip and away she goes. Wow what service. Now if only the airlines could hire her to train the ticket takers."},{"review":"Just a dreadful start and finish to our LA vacation. Rented a car on-line for a week. Pre-paid and got a printed confirmation at an attractive rate. During on-line checkout, I declined all additional insurance and loss damage waivers as I am personally covered. Upon arrival I was in line at the rental desk for an hour. Could not understand if I prepaid and had my printed receipt, why I had to wait so long for a clerk. The clerk started the rental process from the beginning. I said wait, I did all this on-line, here is my receipt. He said we don't have your information in our computers at the rental desk. \"They may have it at corporate but we get no information here\" Huh? When I questioned why his final rental cost was higher than on my printed receipt, he said it was because I took a fueling option. I was wary but I thought I was safe because I had an agreed upon printed rate and receipt and I refused any add-ons when I was booking on-line. Not so, after I got my second credit card bill, it shows I accepted a loss damage waiver (at the desk, not on-line) that was significantly more than the cost of the car rental itself. Customer service was almost nasty to tell me you clearly checked the box sir you owe the money. Beware this smells like a complete flim flam to me and everyone is complicit. Beware of \"sign here, here, and here and initial here, here, here, and here\". Really they are very slick in the way they go about it. AAA should be ashamed to partner with them by offering discounts. NEVER AGAIN"},{"review":"I made this reservation for my wife. I had always trusted Hertz for its good reputation worldwide and through my own experience when I worked in Ithaca, NY. However, the way that the LAX branch staff member handled this rental has really upset us. He offered my wife an upgrade to a large car without explaining the cost involved. Today when I asked my wife to show me the rental agreement, I was shocked to learn that the \"upgrade\" ($200+) cost more than the entire original car rental quote. My wife still thought the \"upgrade\" was free until I pointed this out today. She was also persuaded to buy an additional insurance to cover uninsured third party which I think is unnecessary but least she knew the cost involved before signing on the dotted line."},{"review":"NEVER go for DOLLAR car rental. I visited end of this Aug and booked car online with Dollar at LAX airport location. Had a worst ever experience as customer agent sounded more like an insurance policy salesman. he literally forced me to buy the expensive insurance by scaring me like anything. I refused 2-3 times and mentioned I am already insured through my car company. Then he started saying in California they don't accept this insurance. All lies. I checked with my insurance company and it covers rental car for both liability and collision. When I finally made my mind to not buy, he started scaring me that you are doing a big mistake and ultimately scared me out to buy the expensive insurance.\nMoreover, they claim their prepaid gas (pay for fuel in advance) is lowest price in area (and it was not actually lowest), on top of that, they charged me for a 15.6 gallon tank without even knowing which car I am gonna choose. The car I chose had a tank capacity of 13.6. They charged me $56 in total for prepaid fuel and in my whole trip of 10days, I never had to pay more than $38 for gas even after close to fully empty tank. I even posted complaint on their website but they never responded. So all these are just money making strategies.. drop the price and force customers to other traps!!"},{"review":"Almost ruined my vacation. My worst car rental experience ever. Took 40 minutes to talk to the person that rented me a car. He kept trying to up sell which I did not want. I wanted a full size car. He gave me a Kia Optima, which Kia describes as their mid size car. I rented thru AAA and got 3rd party insurance thru AAA. Hertz kept warning me about this and trying to sell me their insurance. They also charge 9.99\/gallon of gas. I actually felt threatened by this guy and I did accept the car because I had just traveled 8 hours, it was late, and getting a different car at the last minute would have meant a bus trip back to the airport and probably getting gouged because of being last minute. If I come to LAX again I will not use Hertz!"},{"review":"I showed up at the Hertz rental station at LAX with a confirmed reservation for a mid-sized SUV. However, Hertz did not in fact have an SUV, and in order to get a vehicle of the size I needed, I had no option but to rent a premium SUV, at a surcharge of $600. Despite repeated requests, Hertz has refused to stand behind the commitment in its reservation or to refund the surcharge. I would NEVER rent from this Hertz location again, and caution anyone who is considering it to do so only as a last resort."}],"name":"South Los Angeles","rating":"1.5","phonenumber":" 310-568-5100","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

Though the map has Lucy still marked, she has moved to her hometown of Jamestown, NY. \n\nIf you have a few hours and looking for something different, then visit Forest Lawn or the Hollywood Forever Cemetery."},{"review":"Wasnt sure about visiting this Park but was the most beautiful place to see. Cant believe how big an area it covers and it is so beautifully kept. Also cant believe how easy it is to drive around the whole place. worth a visit if you want somewhere special to go on your visit to Los Angeles"},{"review":"If you come here to find celebrities, ten you must do your research before hand. They are reluctant to direct you to the locations and often times, the sites are gated or private."},{"review":"Forest Lawn, Glendale is not just a cemetery \u2013 it is an art gallery, a museum a Hollywood tourist attraction with architectural masterpieces showcased here. It\u2019s the final resting place of movie stars. The grounds are so huge, you will need a map to find a particular grave. When it comes to locating celebrities, the staff do not give you any information. It has a replica of Rudyard Kipling\u2019s church and you can view the world's largest permanently mounted religious painting in the world in a state-of-the-art theatre. 'The Hall of the Crucifixion' and Resurrection measuring 195 feet (59 m) in length by 45 feet (14 m) in height is the panoramic painting by the Polish artist Jan Styka \"The Crucifixion.\" It has reproductions of famous works of art (1500 statues). It is the only place in the world containing replicas of all of Michaelangel\u2019s works in one place. The castings were taken from the originals and the marble used were from the same quarries in Italy as his original sculptures. David and Moses will keep you spellbound and the stained glass recreation of Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \u2018The Last Supper\u2019 in the Memorial Court of Honor is truly awesome. William Bouguereau's 84x60 inch, oil on canvas painting, created in 1881 titled the \"Song of the Angels\" is one of the most famous objects in the permanent collection. Don\u2019t miss the large mosaic - The Signing of the Declaration of Independence and also the 13-foot (4.0 m)-high statue of George Washington. Ronald Regan was married here at the \"Wee Kirk 'o the Heather\". The huge memorial park does not have any upright grave markers \u2013 instead it has huge trees, rolling green hills, water fountains and splendid statuary. The main gates of Forest Lawn \u2013 Glendale are claimed to be the world's largest wrought-iron gates. You will need a car to visit. Pick up a map at the information kiosk at the entrance of the grounds just to find your way around this massive park."},{"review":"the two churches are beautiful.

There are 2 Forest Lawns - this one and the one in Glendale. Each is huge, feature lots of interesting things to see and there are, of course, the graves of the stars. Most of the \"biggest\" are in the Glendale site but this one is worth a visit. DO NOT visit a cemetery thinking that they will give you a map of the stars graves - they do not.

Better prices and more fun hunting at yard sales and thrifts."},{"review":"Went with my teen daughter - what an adventure! We went fast and still spent nearly three hours wandering the aisles. Not always a bargain but many stalls were well-curated with vintage clothing\/shoes\/accessories, costume jewelry, repurposed furniture...and a few food options too. \n\nPark a few blocks back and walk in (double check parking restrictions on the signs!) , it's alot easier than dealing with the lot."},{"review":"I really like this flea market for the variety, food and drink options, and large quantities of clothing and household items that it offers! There's a lot to see but my daughter and I usually can cover it in around 2 hours and always end up with something fun! It's open 9 - 5 Sunday's and parking can be a challenge so prepare to walk from at least a few blocks away unless you get lucky. Some vendors accept credit cards but others don't so bring plenty of cash to avoid the high ATM fees on site.

Look for tours - they are not offered very often."},{"review":"This house is such an american and L.A. icon, that it is impressive to see it in person.\nThe house is small, and yes there are some rooms that are off limits, but the experience of visiting the site is still really wonderful. We attended a sunset tour, so we were able to see the transformation of both the house and the city below from sunset into dark... \nThe cost of the tours is quite high, though this is well used to preserve and upkeep the house, and the number of visitors is strictly limited per group... so you can get the nice \"archi-photos\" that you want without hoards of people in the way."},{"review":"Absolutely worth your money! It was only 70 for 2 and our docent, Scott was brilliant and he's actually the main guide and he preserves the place alongside the children. He allowed all of us to enter the 2 off limit bedrooms and even opened the other sliding door at the most left corner of the house. \n\nOur tour was at 5:30pm and we are asked to arrive by 5:20 for the briefing outside. We were 17 and only 2 from the group lived in LA, the rest were Europeans, Australians, Asians etc. As you enter the gate, you instantly feel the uniqueness and character of the home. He toured and told us stories for about 20-30 minutes and the rest of the period we were allowed to roam freely around the place. \n\nElated and would do this again in the night time."},{"review":"There's no better place to see a fantastic view over LA, this is a truely unique and worthwhile experience. The admission price was completely worth it, it's lovely that the family open up the privately owned family home to the public. We did an evening tour which was perfect to see the day, dusk and night light. \nOur host was a member of the family and made us feel really welcome. It was nice to get an insight into how the Stahl family have enjoyed living in the house over the years. The personal touch was really appreciated and you get the feeling that the house is really well looked after. \nSome tips: Get there early to park outside the house rather than on the road, we didn't need our print out on the day (the host had a list of bookings) and be ready to take off your shoes. Also have a read up about the history of the house beforehand as on the day it's more about looking around and getting a sense of the place rather than a 'tour' as such. There were articles spread out for you to read but mostly you'll just want to soak up the atmosphere of being in this magical spot."},{"review":"So good I almost don't want to tell people about it! The more people who go, the more strain on this piece of wonderful LA heritage. The good news is that LA is getting better at valuing it's past, and so we get the chance to see places like the Stahl house. Fantastic architecture that has stood the test of time. Part of the Case House program, a wonderful contribution to domestic architecture. Stunning views down onto Sunset Boulevard, looking across the houses of the rich and famous. Great service and knowledge from the docent. Intelligent, adult tourism. For a really interesting perspective, head down to Sunset after viewing the house and spot it on the hilltop as you look up - it's not easy but adds to the understanding of what the house is and it's place in history\/LA."},{"review":"As a fan of mid-century modern design, visiting the Stahl House was a meaningful experience. As a person who loves to visit L.A., visiting the Stahl House in the Hollywood Hills was, simply put, a really cool thing to do.\n\nWe chose the early evening time to visit and got to see the sun set and L.A. come alive with millions of twinkling lights. The greater than 180 degree views are amazing.\n\nOur docent was friendly, informative, and made for a relaxing visit. The other guests were respectively quiet.\n\nThere are two metal chairs situated outside near the pool but at the edge of the property. Sitting on them for 10 or so minutes in the quiet, with the sun setting and the city below, made for a zen-like ethereal experience. Not something easily achieved in this city!\n\nWe will definitely visit the Stahl house again."}],"streetAddress":"1635 Woods Drive","postalCode":"90069","name":"Stahl House","rating":"5.0","phonenumber":" (208) 429-1058","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

The whole \"tour\" can be wrapped in 30 min max. So please get out and walk! \nSome of the houses are in beautiful shape others need a million dollar renovation. And that is the beauty of this visit : you walk around, you pick the house you could see yourself living into, you see one that looks very bit up and you think: what a great set for a horror movie! And then, you try to imagine the old old lady who owns it and all these nasty real estate sharks waiting for her to finally die. Anyway, in order to enjoy this, you need to be into architecture, history and be a curious mind. \nPush the walk further about 15 min and check out the Echo Park lake down the hill. They did a great job renovating it. It is a very pleasant place to have a picnic, read a book in the shade, chat your ears off with a friend you have not seen for a while. If you do both in one day you'll tell yourself: \"Los Angeles is a pedestrian friendly town, and this area is adorable.\"\nWell don't get carried away here! 15 years ago this was \"a no go zone\" but it is true that you can walk and walk around Echo Park and feel safe and happy."},{"review":"We drove Carroll Ave to look at the Victorian homes.

It adjoins the LACMA grounds and you will be able to walk past the large pit out of the front which has been there for around 40,000 years, where all the poor animals (some of them prehistoric) got trapped. The museum itself, within the park, does have an entry fee, but is very fascinating and worthwhile, as you can see the scientists working on new discoveries from the pits, amongst other things. There are a number of pits being actively excavated and new discoveries still being found. You can view this out the back of the museum (once again, in the free park area) and if you are lucky, you may stumble across a free talk by one of the scientists. It is fascinating."},{"review":"We visited La Brea Park after visiting the LACMA and it was a nice experience. We walked following the stablished route and saw the tarpits and the fossils.

It's worth your time and it's one of the only green spaces I came across during my stay. There are several tar pits you can stop by and look at. As they are always excavating there's a giant fenced off area full of mysterious skips with who knows what inside!

It is a very moving experience."},{"review":"Absolutely everyone needs to take a few hours of their life and be here. You will be a better person for it. Teach your children: tolerance, compassion, peace, have a voice, love & appreciate one another."},{"review":"My wife and I have previously visited the concentration camp sites of Auschwitz and Dachau, and I have visited the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC. These were very moving experiences for us. We were curious what the Museum of Tolerance might present. We attended an informative 1-hour talk by a holocaust survivor, which was the highlight of our visit. We were somewhat put off by the enforced pacing of visitors in the holocaust portion of the museum: doors automatically open and close to shepherd visitors from one area to another after audiovisual presentations in each section. This section of the museum could be informative to people who are unfamiliar with the holocaust and who would be receptive to a broad-brush overview. But the presentation did not evoke in us the empathetic emotional reactions that the other memorials we have visited did, perhaps because there were no compelling visual displays that allowed for self-paced reflection. \nA second section has a broader focus, emphasizing the need for tolerance. It mostly relies on displayed text, images, and a few interactive stations. It's wide-ranging focus trends toward superficial coverage...a survey rather than a spotlight. For us the latter would have been more compelling. \nIf you have been to the other holocaust memorial sites such as those mentioned above and\/or you are already informed of the events related to the holocaust, you could probably by-pass this museum in favor of other cultural opportunities in Los Angeles. If you are curious about what happened during those horrible times, you can learn quite a bit from a visit."},{"review":"A truly moving experience for our entire party that ranged from 9 to 76. You simply must attend one of the talks from a holocaust survivor if you have the chance. We all listened intently for an hour and could have listened for another few hours.

Thank You so much."},{"review":"My visit started on a sour note as they initially turned me away for not having reservations. Seems that there were some school groups and they were full. I made reservations for some hours later and returned.\nAlso, the museum does not permit food, drinks, cameras and any sharp objects (all understandable) but they provide no place to put them if you bring them by mistake. Therefore, everything goes in the garbage. The guard told me that a whole group had brought Swiss army knives the day before and they all went in the trash bin. They definitely should have lockers outside the admission area. They mercifully allowed me to bring in my camera with the promise that I wouldn't photograph anything. (I didn't)\nThe museum is fascinating and well designed. Very informative, original and interactive. My 12-y.o. son, who is very hard to please, found it interesting and worthwhile and even agreed that it would be good to try to see the one we have here in NY. \nThe restaurant was a bonus for us as it is not only kosher but good food, nice choices and reasonable prices."},{"review":"did not start off to well as did not take my passport and a very rude security guard would not let me in to park but on entrance all ok took a guided tour with a group and was there for a very informative couple of hours with exhibits videos and a very knowing guide you have to go i dare you not to be moved"},{"review":"This has something for every age, and is staffed by people who care. From learning about immigration for the younger set (an LA version of the NYC Tenement Museum tour), to being reminded about prejudice and hatred of every type for all ages, you can't go wrong at this moving yet still pleasant museum.

While there are elements of the region's history and some background of people who migrated to the area, most of the focus was on the entertainment industry. Sure, the industry is a big player in Los Angeles, and Gene Autury was obviously a major influence in the museum, but I was expecting more general history.\n\nThe cafe was really good, and it was great that we could park for free. There was also a farmer's marking going on while we visited. It was nice to get some fresh fruit.\n\nIf you're interested in western movies, this is a great museum to visit. If you're looking for a more general history of the American west, you may be disappointed."},{"review":"Had an enjoyable visit, and the cafe is good too. \nThere were no crowds, and I understand it is like that most of the time. \nThis falls into the category of \"very do-able\" museums, that is, you don't have to invest a whole day. \nLoved the section on depiction of the west in movies and tv, and the care taken to explore the role of Native Americans, women, African-Americans...\nAnd who knew there could be a Michael Jackson link!"},{"review":"Super kitsch, wide range of western items.

Currently, they have an exhibit on California and the American Civil War. There is a heavy emphasis on the Native American experience in the war. The displays are easy to read (big print, easy content to comprehend), and there are several interactive displays which are designed for children, probably 4th grade and older. The museum also has a gallery of western art which includes a few Remington's, some Navaho woven blankets and textiles, and various paintings. Finally, there was a wonderful gallery of Hollywood's portrayal of the west in movies and television. This alone makes a visit to this facility worthwhile as there are clips of television shows and some of the original costumes worn by the actors. \nThe only side note I would add is that the museum may not be interesting to very small children and the Los Angeles Zoo directly across the street might be a better choice."}],"streetAddress":"4700 Western Heritage Way","name":"Museum of the American West","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" 323-667-2000","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Tue - Fri","time":"10:00 am - 4:00 pm"},{"days":"Sat - Sun","time":"11:00 am - 5:00 pm"}]},

I loved the entire area around Westwood Village with its vintage movie theatres, great little shops, pubs and restaurants. Didn't have that hang-dog student feel that so many student areas tend to have. The gardens were established in the late 1920, when it was probably a lot quieter in the area than it is now. The garden is run by the botany department at UCLA and each plant or tree is marked with its name. It was a pleasant pre-dinner walk in a coold green atmosphere."},{"review":"LOS ANGELES CA - It's easy to describe the Mathias Botanical Garden, on the southeast side of the UCLA campus in Los Angeles, as restful. It's another thing entirely to try and call it \"quiet.\"\n\nThe garden, established in 1929, is in the heart of the city, and sounds of the metropolis invade from every side. Cars honk, breaks squeal, truck exhausts bellow and belch. They are accompanied by the daily murmur of surrounding student life: walkers and runners, friendly conversations, and cell phone monologues.\n\nMildred E. Mathias, for whom the garden was named in 1979, was a pioneer in ethnopharmacology, the science of discovering new medicines derived from rain forest plants. Not surprisingly, the 7-acre garden is a diverse one with species of all kinds and from many geographies. On any given day visitors will find volunteers armed with rakes, shovels and other tools, carefully tending the plants and keeping its many paths well groomed.\n\nSomething seems to always be blooming in the garden, and that was the case during an early April 2014 visit. But the spring season is primarily a time for new, green growth, and that was in greatest evidence during a trail walk then.\n\nBecause the garden is supervised by UCLA's Botany Department (the botany building is nearby, and houses the garden offices), walking through it is as much an educational as a natural experience.\n\nEach plant and tree variety is labeled for easily identification and study. In some areas students have created experimental growing areas. One section of the garden is devoted to a backyard wildlife habitat, so amateurs can duplicate their own piece of environmental heaven at home. An amphitheater called \"The Nest\" is used for outdoor programming.\n\nThe trails are interspersed with plenty of seating, both free-standing and built into retaining walls. Tables are available for game players, and comfortable chairs and benches for readers. Some of the trails, which follow a stream and lead to a small waterfall, are wheelchair-accessible.\n\nWildlife is found in the garden too. Coy and turtles inhabit the stream. UCLA online information also indicates squirrels fill the garden's wooded areas, but don't feed them, it cautions. \"The squirrels are aggressive and they bite,\" it warns.\n\nIf You Go ...\n\nMildred E. Mathias Botanical Garden\n777 Tiverton Dr., Los Angeles CA 90095\n\nGoogle Map: http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/cs2SB\n\nDate Visited: 2014-04-04\n\nTime To Budget: At least an hour.\nHours: Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\nSaturday and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.\nAdmission: Free\nWheel-chair Accessible: Yes\nEvents: Free docent-led tours held on the first Saturday of every month at 1 p.m. No reservations needed. Call 310-825-1260 for information."},{"review":"This garden has a beautiful setting and provides a nice stroll. I like how it's wild and you can just explore the many different directions and paths. It's great for plant lovers, or to just sit in one of the many benches (and even the arena and picnic tables) to read or have lunch. I went on a weekend so it was really quiet, which I enjoyed."},{"review":"My husband and I strolled through this small garden while visiting our daughter in college. It was so pleasant, educational, and well landscaped. You could tell a lot of effort was put into these gardens."},{"review":"Download a map and self-guided tour from the website and go for a stroll. Not just beautiful flowers but also a lot of unusual and interesting plants and trees, like two very tall Australian eucalyptus that are obviously very happy as they have turned into towers in just 40 years. Personally, I find botanical gardens boring pretty quickly and just tag along for my wife. But this was definitely a worthwhile experience that held my interest.\n\nYou may be able to escape the gouging parking fees on the UCLA campus by parking at a meter ($1\/hr) on Hilgard or Le Conte. There is an entrance about where those two streets meet.\n\nWhile the city noise is apparent at the edges, much of the garden is at a lower level and thus well-shielded. We saw a few students and a professor sitting on benches near the stream and we actually whispered as we walked by so as not to disturb their reading."}],"streetAddress":"Near Hilgard Ave and Le Conte Ave","postalCode":"90024","name":"Mildred Mathias Botanical Gardens","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" +1 310 825 3620","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Mon - Fri","time":"8:00 am - 5:00 pm"},{"days":"Sat - Sun","time":"8:00 am - 4:00 pm"}]},

I do remember sitting on the curb as a kid admiring all the trucks and equipment of the movie crews which blocked the street while filming scenes of 'Petey Wheatstraw' with XXX comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whom I remember occupied a corner apartment on the first floor. ( I remember touring the apartment with a few neighbors and recall the apartment being dimly lit, but filled with bright red furnishings. ( a lot of velvet). I was saddened to again see that in maybe '81 or so, how abandoned and run-down looking it had become. From once a busy place where several stars would frequent to an empty building where childhood friends from the block along with myself would ride our bikes in the vacant lot behind it and have mud fights in the months when it rained heavily and the lot would fill with water. Sad that it\"s become just an apartment building with so much of it's history being unknown to the people who occupy it, but happy to know that it's still there."},{"review":"The Dunbar Hotel was built in 1928 by John Alexander Somerville in order to afford African Americans with elegant accommodations during their stay in Los Angeles. It was named after African American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. The hotel often hosted famous guests like Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, Cab Calloway and other jazz legends. Nowadays the Dunbar is an apartment building, but it still offers old charm and is worth a look while you're walking down Central Avenue."},{"review":"I went to a reading of an original play entitled \"The Magnificent Dunbar Hotel\" produced by the Robey Theatre Company at the restored Dunbar Hotel on Central Ave. The play features historical characters including Paul Robeson, Joe Louis, Lena Horne, Ethel Waters, W.

A landmark of Los Angeles' African American history, the Dunbar was the meeting place for great minds to gather to affect change in the Black community. The beauty of the restored Dunbar is a piece of history to be treasured and the \"The Magnificent Dunbar Hotel\" written by Levy Lee Simone and directed by Ben Guillory is a must see play."}],"streetAddress":"4225 South Central Ave","postalCode":"90011","name":"Dunbar Hotel","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" +1 323 231 0333","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This place definitely has its pros and cons. My wife and I brought our three girls here,  ages 6, 5, and 2. All the girls seem to have had a fun time,  so I am giving a 2 star rating. For me, there were too many cons to bring the score any higher than that. \n\nLet's start with the pros...\n-all my girls had a fun time,  and that's what really matters in the end. \n-nice for smaller kids. lower level play area is simple. The girls kept themselves busy for a few hours, especially my 2 year old.  \n-inexpensive entry fee. We are members of the Association of Children's Museum Reciprocal Program through our membership at Skirball, and we thought the entrance was free. Upon entering,  the lady at the front desk said that it was only half off.\n-free secured outdoor parking.\n\nAnd the cons...\n-no signage in front of the building indicating that Zimmers is inside. Passed the building the first time around. \n-supposed to be a museum (it's in the title) but not one thing about this place screams museum. Not one interactive learning activity here. It's basically a play area for smaller kids. \n-the place is small and cramped. Pretend City in Irvine puts this place to shame. Stroller parking almost took up the whole area of the entrance. Lower level play area was jam packed with people.\n-My wife and I both thought it wasn't very clean. She thought the place was understaffed, but maybe the workers that were there just didn't clean enough. There were some workers picking up here and there, especially since toys get moved and dropped at every area.\n-no real supervision going on. Would have been nice if someone at least manned that boat and ball pit area, surprised I didn't see a kid jump and crack someone's skull open. Can't really see if a kid is submerged in the balls. \n-not sure if there was handicapped access to the lower level, didn't see an elevator anywhere."},{"review":"We went on the Free Museum day in L.A and good thing we went early because the line got big really quickly. It was more of a playground to me than museum. My kids had a lot of fun and that was the whole point. They have a ball pit which my kids loved, but they only let you play 5 minutes and you have to let other kids get in. It's cute, but I wouldn't have paid to get in. Sure it's multicultural and they have a wall where you write a message and stick in the wall."},{"review":"Take your kids and you will enjoy yourself as well, this is a museum with a message for the young and old. The staff are well trained and plentiful."},{"review":"This place is fun for kids under 3 Thursdays is grandparents go In For free. It was fun and cute my toddler had a lot of fun."},{"review":"This is a small kid-friendly place with lots of educational play. There's water play tables and fun ball pit surrounding inflatable boat. There's alot of education surrounding Jewish culture which is interesting. There's a little pretend play bakery, shop, puppet theatre, library and also a cushion play area for just the under-two-year-olds. We bought a 10 visit pass for $50 which gave us 5 visits for my four yo and myself. Pretty worth it!"},{"review":"I took my four and a half year old here after reading the reviews about it being appropriate for preschool aged children. \n\nWe were in there for 30 minutes before my son ran out of things to do. It may be that we went on a bad day because one of the few things they have to play with is a water table but the water table was broken and turned off. They also have a ball pit but it was so busy we had to stand in line for ten minutes to get five minutes of play time in the ball pit. \n\nThe place is absolutely tiny. They have an ambulance you can get into and a plane but again, there were about 20 children in each of those because the place is so small with such limited things to do. \n\nIf you've been to one of the true children's museums, like the Please Touch in Philly, Zimmer will shock you. They try to do the same thing as Please Touch but in 1\/20th the space. So they have a supermarket where kids can pretend to shop just like the bigger museums but the supermarket space at the Zimmer is the size of a very small walk in closet packed with kids who can barely move around.\n\nOverall, it was a very unpleasant experience. I did see a bunch of 18 month to 2 year olds seeming to have a good time. So if you have very young children, then it may be ok. If your child is over 3, I definitely do NOT recommend this place. \n\nIn fact, when we were leaving, my son said, \"mom, can we never come back here?\" This from a child who always wants to go back to any place we've ever been!"},{"review":"We spent a couple hours in the afternoon here. I took my twins (almost 4) and infant with my 12yearold sister. The museum is small but fun. The kids had a blast but after an hour we'd seen and done it all so they did it again! They really did not want to leave."},{"review":"Small in size, but big fun! That's how I'd describe the Zimmer, one of LA's hidden treasures. Two things to understand before you go. (1) This a museum strictly for the pre-school crowd. Older kids might find the activities too juvenile and\/or be annoyed by the toddlers. (2) This is a jewel of a museum, i.e. it's NOT a destination attraction but more for locals or frequent visitors to the area. \n\nThat said, it is a wonderful way to pass a few hours... or a whole morning or afternoon. There's a small ball pit, water table, pretend grocery store and restaurant... even a pretend synagogue! Our 17 month old child was enthralled for more than two hours and didn't want to leave.\n\nThe staff is just wonderful... kind, welcoming, and really seem to enjoy kids. There's no cafe, but there is a snack room with vending machines and room for those who bring their own food. It's likely, however, that your kids will have so much fun, they won't stop to eat. \n\nParents of crawlers will appreciate the V.I.B. (Very Important Baby) playroom, but the museum is best experienced by walkers.\n\nNOTE: The museum is sponsored by a Jewish family, so it is closed on Saturdays to respect the Sabbath."},{"review":"I had wanted to go to this museum for many years. I finally had a chance and went this month (October 2012). The parking is underground and a security guard has you open the back of the car (we had a SUV) before you are allowed in to park. The parking is free. The museum is not. It was $15.50 per person to get in. You also have to pass through security again and they open and inspected our handbag as well as had us unzip our cosmetic cases. The day we were there there were two Holocaust survivors speaking. We did not stay for the talk by the survivors. We toured museum only. There is a part were you enter through two doors at a specific time and then follow around through various exhibits which were either animated, had videos or photos. My only complaint was there was no sort of direction on what we were to do or where to go. Some exhibits were dark and \"came to life\" after waiting around awhile. There were plenty of opportunity to sit down (always appreciated in a museum). What we did see was very moving and extraordinarily emotional. Although I thought I knew quite about about this time period I was amazed by how much more there was to this period in history. I would recommend this tour as part of visiting L.A."},{"review":"We visited Zimmer Museum for the first time over the weekend as part of the Smithsonian's Free Museum Day program. At 1 year old, I think my son may be a little too small to enjoy this play area but I did find the concepts to be entertaining. He especially liked one small room that was full of soft playmats - perfect for my kid who likes to throw himself onto a beanbag chair or pile of pillows. Some other exhibits, the pretend cafe for example, were too advanced for him however, I did notice many other kids engaging there which I found to be so cute. We will come back here but perhaps once he is a little older."}],"streetAddress":"6505 Wilshire Blvd","postalCode":"90049","name":"Zimmer Children's Museum","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" 323-761-8984","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Sun","time":"12:30 pm - 5:00 pm"},{"days":"Mon - Thu","time":"10:00 am - 5:00 pm"},{"days":"Fri","time":"10:00 am - 4:00 pm"}]},
{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"I recently visited the LAFD Historical Society's Memorial and Museum on Fire Service Day. Coincidentally, it was the same day as their Annual Pancake Breakfast. The two-story of Fire Station was filled with all kinds of memorabilia from original fire department badges to beautifully restored fire apparatus. It\u2019s a great place for kids of all ages. Open on Saturdays only or by appointment for tours. There is no fee, but donations are appreciated."},{"review":"The place is interesting in it's own right, but we went on the Saturday of the Oscars, half of Hollywood was shut down, and we were the only people visiting this place. On the one hand, a total shame, because it's full of history and old fire engines, but on the other hand, we got a private tour from one of the volunteers. He was an excellent guide, really explained the artefacts and exhibits, and really gave you a flavour of how it mush have been working there. Only at the end did he admit to being the retired Fire Chief from the station when it was open !!\nWould totally recommend this place for anyone wanting to see something in Hollywood that isn't related to glitz, glam and the movies"},{"review":"I was lucky enough to find this gem in Hollywood. we went to go visit to see all of the fire trucks and history that they have to offer and it did not disappoint. even though my children I had been to a lot of fire stations this did not disappoint with the history and fire items that they had. The staff was very friendly and accomidating. 2 story building with lots to see and touch. Great for all ages. Nice little gift shop with lots of items to purchase. Best part of the museums is that it is free!!!"},{"review":"We thought this would be a neat quick stop while in downtown L.A. \n\nYou'll recognize the building... you've seen it on TV. The historic building is full of artifacts and equipment from over the years. Some of the equipment is impressive. But I felt this is a museum \"for\" firefighters, not the public. \n\nIt's certainly understandable that operating a museum takes money and staff. The volunteers obviously have worked hard to preserve pieces of history. But more exhibits explaining how quickly a firefighter has to dress out in the middle of the night or Fire trucks that kids can sit in would go a long way toward improving the educational and \"entertainment\" experience of the general public."},{"review":"I'd always been curious about this museum. I'd driven by it so many times. Finally I stopped in and took the tour. I loved seeing the old ambulances and vehicles. This would be a Terrific place to take kids. There is so much opportunity to learning. The museum is small. Even with an hour, you can feel as if you've seen it.

Performance are on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays at 7:00 p.m. Just saw R&J, and the interpretation of the play was so accessible and modern-seeming. Erika Soto, who played Juliet, really nailed the attitude and thoughts of a young, infatuated, teen girl. I am exited to see MAAN. This is my favorite theater company. They always bring a new and refreshing point of view to classic plays. Don't miss them! Performances are ostensibly free, but they ask for donations. Support public theater! Come at least an hour early to get a good seat with your blanket or lawn chairs and eat your picnic dinner."},{"review":"The Taming of the Shrew performance and set was well done. I had read reviews and decided to add this to our LA itinerary. The performance location is a bit hard to find - not well marked from where we entered the park but then we saw signs as we got closer. We parked in Lot 2 and walked up an incline to the location - not scary steep but could be hard for those with mobility issues. The area closest to the stage is \"blanket-only\", further back beach chairs and other higher collapsible chairs are permitted. Some snacks and beverages are available for purchase. Many other audience members brought in dinners and snacks. Restrooms are available near the stage so you don't have to go back down the hill to the parking lot. I'd recommend bringing warmer clothes to layer as the sun goes down. A flashlight is helpful on the walk back down the hill after the performance. Some lights are placed along the path but some areas are rather dark. Highly recommend this for couples and families with teens."},{"review":"Shakespeare in the park: what could be a better way to pass a warm summer evening? This time of the year, Los Angeles' Independent Shakespeare Co. provides just that, offering free-to-the-public productions in Griffith Park's Old Zoo, a short walk from Parking Lot Number 2. Finding the location can seem a bit challenging so be sure to see the directions in ISC's own web site. There's a minor uphill trudge from parking to the performance site and though portable lighting marks the way downhill at night, you may wish to bring your own flashlight if you don't see well in the dark. Note also that apart from the picnic tables which are situated pretty far from the stage, there is no seating in the theatre. Instead, you'll be camped out on the grass. Those seated in areas close to the stage are recommended to bring blankets; in the areas farther from the stage, you're allowed folding chairs or camp seats. Since I've had back issues, I was a bit concerned that I wasn't allowed to use one of those beach chairs which sit very low to the ground since I was sitting up front; fortunately, I was perfectly OK to lounge on our blanket, shifting position as necessary. Also bear in mind that it can get chilly once the sun goes down and a breeze comes up, so you may wish to bring a jacket. And though there are nibbles and water provided at concession stands, you also have the option of picnicking in the theatre as long as you don't include alcoholic beverages. Both performance and parking are free; but you'll be encouraged to make donations if all all possible.\n\nThe performance itself was a rollicking, slapsticky version of Taming of the Shrew brought into a contemporary setting. Artistic license is taken with regard to staging and tweaks here and there to dialog, the result being part Monty Python, part Marx Bros, complete with roller skating, musical interludes, seltzer water, food fights, Spanish dialogue, interaction with the audience, a great deal of scenery chewing, sexual innuendo, a refreshingly different take on Bianca and Petruchio as I'm fairly sure you've never seen him before. (That I will save as a surprise.) For fans of Shakespeare or otherwise, it's impossible not to enjoy this production. All of it is great fun, good acting, lots of laughs-- and there's something indisputably wonderful about lounging on a blanket in Griffith Park, knowing you're in the middle of city with more than 3 3\/4 million people, yet feeling you're apart from it all in this lovely hillside setting. \n\nDo these guys a favor and donate what you can when you're given the opportunity. This is an entertainment tradition which needs to continue."},{"review":"This was our second season of outdoor performances and we love attending! It's relaxed, we eat and have a wonderful time. The performances are always top notch and nothing tops Shakespeare. I brought my Grandkids to one of the cedies and they were enthralled. It's also an excellent date night. I'm looking forward to next season and possibly attending some of the studio performances."},{"review":"Consistently amazing performances. Always true to the text, but accessible to the masses. Fresh insights to classic treasures."},{"review":"I took my wife and two teenage daughters to the old Griffith Park Zoo to experience the Shakespeare in the Park. What a great experience. They set the classic story to a punk rock theme and it was awesome! It was my daughters' first real experience with Shakespeare.\n\nI highly recommend that you go way early to get a good spot!!! Bring a big blanket!!! You can bring a picnic and wine. Nobody says anything unless you are being silly but for the most part, be responsible and you will be fine.\n\nThe actors interact with the crowd during the performance. It really is an experience.\n\nDo not expect to get right out at the end of the show. There is a one lane road in and out of the park. the show caters to roughly over 2K-3K people. There is a bit of a moderate hike of about 1\/4 of a mile up a hill. Bring a flashlight for you way out. They have lighting but it was limited and just enough to get down.\n\nTruly an experience you should not miss!"}],"streetAddress":"3191 Casitas Avenue #168","postalCode":"90039","name":"Independent Shakespeare Co.","rating":"5.0","phonenumber":" 818 710 6306","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

Really improves one's endurance and leg strength. I understand the road were rough with a lot of potholes but the city has come through now since we passed a bill to fix our parks and roads. As of today, March 18, 2015, the roads have been redone. The park has new life, the repaved roads really make a difference. And I'm not talking about just filling up the holes, they destroyed the old pavement and filled it with new pavement. I am happy they fixed them because now I can run on the roads at night and not be afraid to fall and trip from a pothole. They have also added a freesebee golf course which looks like a lot of fun.

I don't get it. Most of these stores are in malls now. Parts of the street are pretty though."},{"review":"We started at a far end of the Boulevard which didn't help.

Its a tired, dirty, has been place that needs more than a prayer and a miracle to get back on its glamourous feet. Lots of customer service people struck up conversations with us (we were obvious foreigners) and all of them suggested other places we should have gone to and steered clear of Hollywood. \n\nOn a bright note - the experience made me extremely grateful for everything I have.

This is a nearly four mile walk around the reservoir and there is no way to stop to buy or get water along the way. I would also make sure you're wearing sunscreen as much of the walk is sunny.\n\nThis is a great walk for someone who doesn't want to \"hike\" but rather prefers a flat walk. I have sciatica and can't do inclines and declines without some pain so I definitely prefer the lovely, flat walk. It's perfect for me. The path is not NEARLY as crowded as Runyon or Fryman so sometimes you can go a few minutes without passing a person which is very nice -- it's like finding a little bit of nature and solitude in the city if only for a few moments.\n\nFor me, the best part of the walk is the bridge (about at the half way mark). From the bridge you have a perfect view of downtown LA on one side and the Hollywood sign on the other. It's really pretty -- I always stop for a few minutes and take it all in, watch the ducks in the water below, birds flying by, etc. For me, it is like an oasis in this busy, crazy city!\n\nAlso, make sure you go to the bathroom before you get there because the bathrooms are Andy Gumps at the bottom of the trail and they are REALLY, REALLY GROSS."},{"review":"When you're on this hike its hard to believe you're in LA.

If you are and out of towner, then allow an hour or more to take a stroll, and be amazed and bring your camera!"},{"review":"I know many tourists like commercial things or big-deal attractions, and this isn't among them. It's a half-mile-long mural painted by local people depicting the history of California and Los Angeles. Colors are bright. The mural is clean and free of graffiti -- maybe because it was done by graffiti artists.\n\nIt's advertised as being part of Los Angeles, but we found it in a brochure for attractions in North Hollywood. You can't see much of it just driving by. You have to park your car and get out. Then walk along a little grassy strip and look through a chain-link fence. If you have a good camera and know how to use manual focus (or how to fool the camera) you can shoot it without the fence being much of a problem. Very serious photographers could take a small stepstool and see over the fence."}],"streetAddress":"12920 W.

It is a beautiful house that has be decorated for the era and even has some of the original family's furniture. The docents are very helpful. The house is in the middle of a large park. The only problem is that you can only access the house and the transportation museum on hourly tours. We waited 40 min for the house tour and then had to rush through the transportation exhibit. It would have been better if we could have seen it while waiting."},{"review":"I enjoyed my tour today. Turned out to be just me and the docent. Beautiful old house, excellent example of Victorian design. If you are interested in LA\/Southern California history you need to stop by and take the tour. Friendly staff. The tour takes about 1 1\/2 hours. $5 donation."},{"review":"Step back in time, recommend going around the Xmas holidays when the house is decorated in the Victorian area. Docents are very good, learned a lot about the port of LA. Overall it was a great history lesson. House is fully furnished as it would have been when occupied by the family. Take time to stroll around the grounds . This is a free attraction, but donations of $5 per person are requested. Free parking. Definitely worth a visit."},{"review":"I have been living in SoCal for 30+ years, yet I learned about the Banning Residence Museum from a book I bought at AAA the day before I visited. I had a free Sunday afternoon so I decided to check out the park and museum. What a great time I had! The tour was fun, the home, barn and \u201Cschool house\u201D were interesting, and I would recommend this to both California natives and any tourist wanting to learn about a portion of American history you probably hadn\u2019t studied in school. Banning was a force unto himself in transportation development and in making L.A. a west coast industry center. The home dates from 1863 and is one of the oldest in the area.\n\nSome tips for your consideration:\n(1) Admission is listed as \u201Cfree\u201D but the staff made a donation sound fairly mandatory to me. Five bucks; no worries.\n(2) Park on M Street, which parallels Pacific Coast Highway one block to the south, or on North Banning Boulevard. The closer you are to the park, the nicer the neighborhood.\n(3) Visits to the interior are by tour only so check the times on the website or call ahead.\n(4) If it\u2019s a hot day don\u2019t think there is much relief in the home; there\u2019s no A\/C in there.\n(5) Our tour of the home itself took about 50 minutes. We visited a dozen rooms, and along the way our docent said \u201CI\u2019ll take you over to [ ___ ] if you have extra time.\u201D Say \u201CYES\u201D to everything! Trust me.\n(6) The stagecoach barn is not to be missed. Everyone said \u201Cwhoa\u201D (no pun intended) when our docent opened the door. There is an amazing collection of coaches, wagons and tools (blacksmith and wheelwright), and a row of stables as well.\n(7) See the \u201Cschool house.\u201D The staff is not actually sure that the tiny building was used for educating kids, but the interior is done up to resemble a little kids' school room. Quaint.\n(8) Have the docent take you around to the lower floor entrance where there is a fine exhibit showing the history of how the Port of Los Angeles was created. Including all of the above, I spent almost 90 minutes on the property.\n(9) Photography is not allowed (even without flash) anywhere inside the buildings, but it\u2019s worth strolling the grounds to get some pics of the home."},{"review":"A most beautiful experience! The house is a Neo-Grecian design, 2 story, white with a gorgeous rose garden attached. General Banning had many interests towards the progress of California in the mid-1800's that affect us today, especially with the shipping channel at Long Beach. A worthy investment of a few dollars and a little time for the docent tour."},{"review":"This museum is great! I had a great tour. The docent who guided my tour not only knew her stuff, she know how to tell a great story. Like the one of Phineas Banning, a kid from Delaware who left school at 14, traveled west, worked the docks, and built the port of LA in a swamp (!). LA is more than Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive and Sunset Blvd. Take the time to visit the little gems in greater LA and find out what this place really is about."},{"review":"The Banning Museum is easy to overlook in a city full of attractions, yet often, the overlooked museums are among the best as far as value and experience. A City of Los Angeles managed facility, The Banning Museum is located in Wilmington just down the road from the Drum Barracks Civil War Museum. Time your visit right and spend part of your day at these two museums. Currently, the Banning Museum offers guided tours at select times Tuesday-Thursday and Saturday and Sunday.\nPhineas Banning is one of the fathers of modern Los Angeles. It was his vision (and greed) that lead to a stagecoach line into the city and finally the dredging of San Pedro Harbor to create a vast site for ships to dock and unload. In the mid 1860's Banning had his Greek Revival Mansion built on a vast estate. Visitors can tour two floors on this fine building and enjoy authentic Banning memorabilia and other pieces from the period. The guided tour takes visitors from room to room and to the outside stables. Banning was from Delaware so his home was an homage to the sensibilities of the East Coast. The Banning Museum is a refreshing and fascinating respite from the crowded and routine attractions that dot Los Angeles. Residents and visitors alike should not miss this true gem."},{"review":"OK, it's out of the way - but really where else can you get a full hour plus of undivided attention from the helpful docent? Interesting to see what is essentially an east coast almost plantation style greek revival transplanted to CA. In some ways the presentation is not 'professional' (i.e. every object archived with full history, or even original to the house or family), but it's a great period piece, accessibility is good in the rooms and you see a fair amount of the second floor. Moreover it's free, but really - give the $5 suggested donation and call it a bargain.

Needless to say, we are not quite on the SoCal level ... yet. We frequent the Scottsdale iPic, and always enjoy the experience however, the Westwood version has our home town version beat IMHO, for the theater experience. In terms of immediate surroundings, things to do, and location, Scottsdale wins hands down...once again, IMHO. The LA version used iPads for ordering, and the theater was HUGE. In comparison, the AZ version (as of last visit to see Hobbit Pt.3) was sans the tech in a much more compact setting. Customary attentive service, plush leather seating (in contrast to AZ suede), and a large theater in which to branch out, made a very good impression on the family. Parking in the garage in the building next door was ... interesting. Missed the turnout because of traffic and due to downtown feel of location so, be more attentive than me. Regardless, good time overall, and the kids enjoyed the 532nd rendition of Cinderella. Next time in LA, we'll try the Pasadena iPic, and perhaps the Cinépolis since we have yet to try it out."},{"review":"It's theater with service, but nobody actually came to me for whole time of show.. plus you have different tickets - sofa with cushion, regular seats, and so on...

The drinks and food were good, although it would be nice to have a few healthier options. The ordering process was easy--an iPod like device at your seat--make your choices and the waiter brings them a bit later. A fun but expensive evening (for a movie) that was totally worth it. Plan to spend from $75-$100 for movie, food and adult beverages for two."},{"review":"Not only do they have the giant cushy recliners but they also give you a blanket and a pillow. The staff is great. The food is pretty good for being a movie theater. I recommend the fries (sweet or truffle) and the pizzas. I don't know if I have ever had the burger, but I am guessing that would be pretty good too. Mostly I like that you can really relax and literally put your feet up while you watch a movie.

Came here during summer break on a Friday afternoon. It was hot so the visit was quick for us. We were a bit disappointed because most of the animals were resting. They have a small airconditioned room with different reptiles. (Cool!). They only had one show and tell activity and that was it for the most part.

The kids seemed to enjoy looking at all the animals that were there and there seemed to be very knowledgeable staff working to answer any questions we had.

Here, we had zero complaints. Kids could take in some exotic animals, learn something about them, and quickly move on to the next. Overall, great experience for us all."},{"review":"Small, clean, well-maintained facility with a diverse group of animals. Animals are obviously healthy and active (event the sloth was moving).

These include feeding porcupines, petting a fennic fox or armadillos, among other experiences. There seems to be coupons available fairly regularly on many sites.\n\nOverall it is a fun event to take the family. Bring a camera for sure!"},{"review":"Admission was $7\/adult, $6\/child, though we had a Groupon for this visit which saved us a couple of bucks. We really enjoyed the experience and were amazed at how close we were to the animals. Yes, most are separated from the walkway by a fence, but the animals are very comfortable with people and will roam\/play\/sleep right up against the fence which is often little more than an arm's length away. They don't seem bored or stressed, and some even seem like they like the attention. \n\nWe were done in about 90 minutes and the whole place is rather charming. It's mostly a self-guided tour with trainer shows every hour where you can learn more about an animal up close and touch it. I think it's great for younger kids, but there's something for everyone if you just stop and look.\n\nWLC's size minimizes the time commitment (and the price reflects that), but they have picnic tables and seating areas if you want to spend a bit more time. They also have a variety of \"close encounters\" for small groups, with an additional fee. I'm sure their website lists them in detail.\n\nSince we're close enough, we'll probably come back every few months. The way I see it, I could easily spend two to three times the money going out to the movies. This is by far more interesting and interactive...and just better!"},{"review":"I would have gave it 5 stars if they had more animals. It's a small place that can be seen within an hour. They give an animal show every hour on the hour. It's only $7 for adults, $6 for children and seniors.I went with 4 family members and we all enjoyed it. I'd definitely go back."},{"review":"Bought a 2 for 1 Groupon. After making the drive to Sylmar from Los Angeles, you'll have spent more time in the car than at the Center. It's a very small facility, but you do get to see some animals much closer than you would at a zoo. Porcupines were my favorite, too cute. It sort of seems like a \"home made\" zoo however i believe the animals there are all being rehabilitated or were rescued. It's a sweet place and if you are in the area an easy low cost outing.\nFree street parking was plentiful on a Sunday afternoon and we got to adopt a pet rock :)"},{"review":"I love the Wildlife Learning Center. You actually learn a lot through out their different animal shows through out the day. I strongly recommend one of their private animal tours. A little pricey but you are helping a good cause. All these animals have been rescued and given a second chance. The place is small, you can do it all in one hour if you want. But take your time.

Cabrillo Marine Aquarium is on site with many exhibits to watch. My kids can literally spend entire day at the Aquarium. There is playground on the beach. Shaded picnic area with BBQ grills. There's wifi (you can't get the signal by the water but by picnic area which right next to playground signal is good). Water stay shallow and waves are non existent. If you go on right time and date, you can see cruise boat. \n\nOther things - There's boat launch pad on site for people who like to boat. It's minutes away from San Pedro fish market. Watch out for seagulls if you're picnicking. If you can find parking on the street it's free and very close to the beach. If not paid parking isn't too expensive. On the bay side, there is a paved walkway almost all the way to the water for strollers and wheelchair access.\n\nCons - dirty restroom. It's in San Pedro which is one of major shipping area with cargo ships, cruise ships and every other ships coming and going. I don't know how clean the water is but I can guess not very clean. There is no restaurants or food stand on site. (On weekend that I've seen taco vendors) Plan ahead and grab food from tons of places on the way to the beach."},{"review":"This beach is very nice and clean. Adequate parking was available and the entrance fee is $1.00 per hour, well worth it.

We arrived at 1pm and the parking was already full\/closed and ended up parking at the neighborhood some 30 minutes later.

Here you'll find tide pools galore especially at low tide. About a mile out there are a few sandy parts to the beach and small pieces of sea glass can be found all around. My kids and I love looking for the small rounded pieces of glass and we have found a few rare colors here. I'd definitely recommend water shoes or sneakers for this beach to make walking over the rocks comfortable."},{"review":"They groom this beach in the mornings and it has beautiful views. You can have the waves or be inside the breakwater for a calmer swim. When you look the opposite direction you know you are in the 2nd largest port on the planet. Also you can fish off the pier here. I enjoy this neighborhood in the mornings and early afternoons. I have not been here late. There is also a children's center here called the Bath house which is quite unique. I will continue to walk and hang out here. It is also home to the aquarium which I have not visited yet."}],"streetAddress":"40th St. and Stephen M.

That's philanthropy at its best! We lucked into tickets & rode the Metro downtown to the Broad, it's collection is a priceless marvel. We enjoyed greatly and will return many times! Thank yo Broad Family! ..."},{"review":"The Broad contains an encyclopedic collection of American contemporary art within an accessible and well-conceived building. Most of the best-known American artists of the past fifty years are represented, and the galleries are open and airy, making for a very pleasant tour.\nIf you can't get advanced tickets on-line (I think they're full through March, 2016) line up outside by 10:30 AM on week-days, and you should gain admittance. (Week-ends are more problematic).\nWhen we visited, the cafeteria was not yet built, but for a wonderful lunch, run over to the Disney Center Deli."},{"review":"Only opened since September 2015, the Broad is the latest talk in town. To get tickets, reserve your tickets online (best chance to avoid waiting long). Most reserved tickets are already all booked out until end of the year, so my advice would be to go during a weekday to wait in line if you can't get an advance online ticket.\n\nThe Broad has a pretty diverse collection of contemporary art pieces and installations, spanning over 3 floors. There's a mobile app that you can download in advance that has self-guided tours, which can prove to be rather informative about the art pieces or the architecture of this place. My favorites are Under The Table, The Visitors (you spend over an hour sitting there and watching a 9 screen installation of separate and simultaneous performances happening in the same house, which I find pretty interesting). And of course, the highlight of this museum is the Infinity Mirrored Room, which requires a separate reserved time slot on-site.\n\nUpon entering the museum, head straight to an iPad located on the 1st floor and enter your details. When I went, I was informed that there is a 5 hour waiting period (which ended up to be around 3 hours or so). You then receive a text that has a link to update you your waiting number, and basically use that waiting time to start your exploration of the museum.\n\nIf you are not a fan of contemporary art, it is still worthwhile to visit the museum and admire its architecture. It's designed by world-renowned architectural firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler. I particularly enjoyed walking down the staircase that leads through the \"vault\" storage where they keep their art pieces.\n\nEither way, visit this place at least once just so you can brag to friends and family that you have been here."},{"review":"First - how do get a tix? All tix are free but with a specific time of entry. Most people are getting tix in advance online. BUT, as of mid-November, all tix are gone through early next year. So you're option is to go day-off and wait in line (like me). I got there at 11:15 (the museum opens at 11am). There were about 200 people in line for day-off tickets so the wait was more than an hour. (50 people from the line got in every 30 min).\n\nIn line, staff hand out brochures and there is a free app with great info so use your time wisely by reading and planning ahead.\n\nThe main entrance is cave-like, so take the big escalator up to the third floor and work your way down through the galleries (as the museum recommends).\n\nMost of the 20th century modern art collection is on the third floor with galleries for Warhol, Koon, Lichtenstein, Johns etc. Wide, tall, well lit galleries make it a pleasant museum going experience. Because crowds are restricted, you don't feel rushed or claustrophobic.\n\nFrom the third floor, take steps or elevator to the first floor. The second floor had offices but you can peak through windows to a huge storage area for art.\n\nThe first is seemingly all 21st century art and will likely rotate. Make sure to go to gloat gallery to see the Murakami mural. I highly recommend the video -- The Visitors. Best to wait until the video restarts and watch from the beginning.\n\nThere is a separate free tix requires for the Infinity room. If you're interested immediately upon entering on the first floor stand in line again to get a ticket. But the wait can be daunting -- five hours (!) when I went in.\n\nYou can see the museum in a hour unless you are a committed lover of modern art.\n\nBecause this is LA, it's definitely worth seeing soon for bragging rights."},{"review":"This is a fabulous contemporary art museum with many great works of art. The Broads have good insight and taste which make up a nice collection here. \nArt work is well presented and thought out. The overall experience I had was that my visit was fun, interesting and actually rather glamorous. Staff is very polite and well organized. Entrance times are every half hour and only so many people are allowed in at a time which is very smart. A great weekend activity for everyone and anyone since admission is free for the first year it is open. Very generous of them!"},{"review":"Eli and Edythe Broad have done it again - another free space to enjoy art in the heart of Downtown L.A. Tickets must be reserved online in advance; once you arrive you'll wait in line for a little bit until your entry time is called. Head straight for the kiosk where you can reserve your entry time for the Infinity Mirrored Room (or if you come first thing in the morning, you can just walk in). The museum is chock-full of really cool contemporary art. My favorite is Ragnar Kjartansson's The Visitors, a film shown on 9 screens which runs just over an hour. Another standout is Kara Walker's thought-provoking and disturbing work. There is no food within the museum per se, but there are many nearby restaurants for lunch before or after the museum. Across the street are the Disney Concert Hall and Museum of Contemporary Art. Nearby are the L.A. Central Library, Pershing Square and Grand Park, and Staples Center \/ L.A. Live are a short bus ride away. Both Pershing Square and L.A. Live will have ice skating rinks for the holidays.\n\nTip: Park across the street at California Plaza ($8 all day with validation at the museum; parking at the Broad is $12 for 3 hours)."},{"review":"Contemporary art is a love\/hate relationship for me. I mostly don't get it. It seems if you make it big enough a museum will buy it, and The Broad is no exception to this. However, whether I like a piece or not, it often evokes an emotional response, and that alone can make it worth it. This museum has a great display space, good flow, lots of white space between works, so your mind isn't cluttered by one piece while examining another. The registration and wait to get into the mirrored room is frustrating, but worth it."},{"review":"New museum in LA, modern and cool building, extensive collection of modern artists, including top-artists, like Lichtenstein, Wharhol, Basquiat etc."},{"review":"The Broad is my new favorite museum. The layout is elegant and fresh, the architecture is superb and the art is top notch. All tickets are free but the waiting lost is long so put your order in now. Reserve an early ticket so you can check out the mirrored infinity room right away. Then proceed to explore the rest of the museum. My favorite room is the Ragnar Kjartansson music installation which is so hauntingly beautiful that I couldn't stop the tears from rolling down my face. The room that is covered in Takashi Murakami paintings is incredibly detailed. Go if you haven't yet!"}],"streetAddress":"221 S.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This aquarium is small but works very well for entertaining young kids for a couple of hours. There is a touch tank they can explore (during certain times) and plenty of exhibits in the enclosed area. We went on a weekday and there were only a couple dozen others there. The staff was very friendly. Our children aren't old enough to read all of the exhibits, so just about the time they started to get bored of looking into the various tanks, we were through everything. Entry fee is a donation, which is nice since it is small so you wouldn't want to pay a huge amount to go."},{"review":"Cabrillo Aquarium is right across the parking lot from Cabrillo beach. Being on the smaller side, we were done in less than 2 hours. If you wanted to come to the aquarium and then make a beach afternoon out of it, you'd probably have a decent and fairly inexpensive afternoon. Parking wasn't horrible, $1.00 per hour. The aquarium doesn't have set prices, they ask for donations instead. I gave them $20 for a group of 8. Not bad considering Aquarium of the Pacific charges $28.95 per adult just to get in. They had some really good creatures to see. Giant star fish, giant lobsters, eels, crabs. No seals or otters or rays like at Aquarium of the Pacific. But it's definitely enough to keep your attention. The displays are well kept and super clean. They also had this cool set up where you see the tanks from the front, and then when you turn the corner, you can find a darker hallway and suddenly you're seeing the tanks from the back! And the kids had fun with this because then they kept seeing each other through the tanks and waving. They do have a touch tank area, but it only opens for 20 min and they announce it to you over a loud speaker. We enjoyed the whale section where there were life sized whale bones on display to give you an idea of how huge these creatures really are. I had a group of kids ranging from 13 years old to 2.5 years old. The 13 year old hated the experience. She said there was an odor everywhere and was bored for most of the trip. The 10 year olds and 6 year old enjoyed themselves just fine. I felt it was the right size for the 2.5 year old. No stroller needed, it's not that big. It gave him enough room to explore without it being too crowded or large of an attraction where he could get lost. They also have a lovely library upstairs with books about the sea and animals. Nice to have a few quiet min where the kids could color and we could get some nice a\/c on a hot day. They also have an area with hand puppets and costumes for the kids to dress up in. We took some pics and had a few laughs. Again, geared more toward little kids. My teenager couldn't wait to leave. We packed our lunches and had them in a backpack and they had a really nice shaded courtyard where we just sat down and ate when it was time. No one bothered us, so I assumed it was ok! I would also like to compliment them on their bathrooms. They were VERY clean and ample. Being a mom of four, I can appreciate a clean bathroom for kids & families. All in all, it's a step down from Aquarium of the Pacific, but if you're on a budget, I'd say to go, at least once. I wasn't crazy about the touch tank. Not too many creatures in it and the fact that it was crowded because they only open it for 20 min. If you really want a good experience getting to touch sea life, go to The Sea Lab in Redondo Beach. I've reviewed that and actually prefer it to Cabrillo Aquarium. It's also on a donations system and you get a 1 hour tour with a docent who will tell you cool information about the animals and you'll get to touch WAY more things. So if you're on a budget, have an afternoon to kill and maybe want to hit the beach afterwards, I'd say check out Cabrillo Aquarium. But if your kids are too old, then you may want to skip it."},{"review":"I've been to this place too many times to count since I was a kid for field trips and luckily it's gotten better through the years. They are a small aquarium compared to the one in Long Beach, but it's great for a day trip and less expensive. It has a great location next to a small beach with playground equipment for the kids and plenty of picnic tables in tree shaded areas."},{"review":"This aquarium is a great deal, has a wealth of information and the exhibits are fun for adults and kids. There is no fee but a suggested donation of $5\/person\n\nI would definitely recommend young couples, families with kids and seniors to take a visit."},{"review":"Cabrillo Marine Aquarium reminds me of an aquarium built in someone's garage. This aquarium continues to be a great hands on place for learning. They bring the Ocean to you! Funky, small, accessible, awe-inspiring, and the entry fee is a donation to keep the aquarium running. Go, enjoy, and learn in an uninhibited environment. And the location is breathtaking."},{"review":"Small Aquarium more suited to younger kids. No admission cost for the museum. You have the Cabrillo State Beach in the same parking area. If you want a big aquarium with sharks and yellow fin tuna, go to the Long Beach Aquarium."},{"review":"This aquarium was directly across from the beach\/ocean we went to stick our feet in. There was no cost, only a suggested donation which was minimal. It's a small facility but with a lot of information and animals. There was a hands on area for the entire family which was cool. This was a spur of the moment place to visit and we are glad we did."},{"review":"If you're in the area, go to the Long Beach Aquarium, don't bother with this one. It reminded me of a visit to an elementary school that was having an open house. Yes, they have some small things in tanks like baby fish, some sea urchins, sea stars, and they have some bones that have washed up on the beach, but to truly appreciate our marine life off the coast of California, you have so many other better aquariums to see. The Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, the Long Beach Aquarium, the Monterey Aquarium - all of them are much better. So if you have a choice, go there. Otherwise, this is a cute visit if you happen to be at the nearby beach with the little kids."},{"review":"If you're in the area, I would certainly suggest giving this a visit. We only spent about 45 minutes in there, as we had a little bit of time before dinner, and we were certainly happy we did. Some of the animals in there (such as the largest starfish I have ever seen) were amazing and definitely unique. Even as someone who owns saltwater fish and has visited several aquariums in the past, I found this a unique experience."},{"review":"We love the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium for their great learning experience offered to the guests of all ages. the Aquarium is also very creative for the activities offered.

Things are a little worn overall, so don't expect the high degree of polish you find in some historic home renovations.\n\nIt's only open on Saturdays, and not every Saturday at that, so check ahead on their website.

Hidden in the Pacific Palliasades is the Ray and Charles Eames house. Only to be visited by appointment. A great staff, thank you Catherine for the kind reception, tells you all there is and what you want to know about the life and work of the couple.

This is a wonderful example of the visionary courage of design from the mid century settled in a calm inspiring location. The tours are self guided on the exterior areas only unless you want to pay for the expensive interior tour. Park on Corona del Mar; its a short walk about 800 feet. Note that case study homes 9 and 20 are close by but not open to the public. And the \"lost\" case study home designed by Neutra but later disowned is along the same driveway as the others."},{"review":"I\u2019m a big fan of the work of Charles and Ray Eames, so my first trip to LA became a pilgrimage to their former home. It\u2019s is in Pacific Palisades and you need to book. We had an exterior only visit, however you may also be able to book an interior visit. I found the exterior visit more than adequate, as the large glass expanses of both home and studio buildings allow you to see the interior and furnishings clearly. You can also buy a book about the home and the work of Charles and Ray when you\u2019re there."},{"review":"I loved being able to peer inside the ground level of the house and studio. Seeing everything that the Eames had designed and collected was fascinating, and the staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Call for their hours, but it appears you only need to make a reservation if you want to tour the inside (which was $275 for two people while we were there.) We just parked one block up and paid our $10 admissions. Students with ID and children were free when we went."},{"review":"We went there while visiting LA from the Midwest . Our dtr recently graduated from a top industrial design program and insisted we go there while visiting . You have to call ahead to make a reservation , admission to the site is $10, for only an outdoor view. It's a few hundred to step inside. The people who volunteer there are very nice. You can see into the house pretty easily. If you are into design you should go."},{"review":"Parking is on-street around the corner and $10 to enter the grounds. We called on the morning of our visit and were able to make a reservation, but website recommends calling 48 hours in advance. Even though you cannot enter the house, the glass walls allow a clear view inside. Grounds are a nice walk; there are several stations with information about the building of the house and its changes over the years. Nice ocean view too. Staff are available for questions. Take a look at the staff's map of the neighborhood where the house is located; there are 2 or 3 other Case Study houses there, of which you can catch glimpses as you walk back to your car."},{"review":"The Eames House is significant architecturally in that it was one of a couple of dozen homes built as part of The Case Study House Program. The publisher of Arts and Architecture Magazine started the program to support budding architects during the post World War II era, using modern technology from the war.\n\nMy husband and I took the interior tour of the house. Very pricey at $275 for 1-2 persons, but well worth it if you love design. The dollars go for a good cause toward preservation and maintenance of the property. Plus, I am an interior designer and it was my birthday, so I treated myself! \n\nYou can do self guided exterior tour of the grounds for $10 per person. Reservations are required for this, as well. Do not miss this opportunity since the grounds are beautiful and you can see inside most of the glass house anyway from the exterior. You can also walk through the gardens and onto the patios that the Eames designed. Just excellent!\n\nFor the interior tour, I enjoyed the detailed information that the docent provided, the ability to see items in the house closely and the fact that the house remains essentially the way it was, furnishings, artifacts and all, from the end time that the Eames lived there. The house is an example of good, functional design. It also was an inspiration to me, as a designer, to see the common objects that brought so much joy to Ray and were her daily design inspiration. It was a delight to see the interior of the adjoining design studio where Ray and Charles worked.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit, especially the exterior grounds tour. Don't miss it if you are in the LA area.\n\nThere are no interior restrooms, but a high end port-o-let on the property."},{"review":"Having flown across the world to see the building, we decided to splash out and get an interior tour. It was BRILLIANT! I totally recommend going the extra and paying for this tour- it was worth every penny.\n\nOur tour guide was so knowledgeable and friendly (an incredibly helpful young woman we think was called Katherine ?) and we were able to spend a good couple of hours hearing about the house, looking at all the amazing objects in the house (including playing with the incredible musical marble run) and asking lots of questions, as well as looking through all the construction drawings for the house.\n\nIt was such a privilege to spend time in the living room, it felt that the interior of the house really explains the warmth and fun of Charles and Ray and gives a new understanding of their design philosophy ! \n\nAlthough expensive, all the money goes to a great cause and it was totally amazing. Could not recommend more highly, especially of the tour guide.\n\nThank you for showing us round!\n\n\n"}],"streetAddress":"203 \/ 205 Chautauqua Boulevard","name":"Eames House","rating":"5.0","phonenumber":" 310-459-9663","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Sun","time":"10:00 am - 4:00 pm"},{"days":"Mon - Tue","time":"10:00 am - 2:00 pm"},{"days":"Thu - Fri","time":"10:00 am - 2:00 pm"}]},

Farther west you'll travel through the heart of Hollywood, then West Hollywood, LA's tony, gay neighborhood, then down through the exciting Sunset Strip and out into Beverly Hills, where magnificent mansions line both sides of the street. A little further on, you'll pass Westwood, home of UCLA, and chic, mega wealth, Bel-Air. Crossing over the 405 Freeway, Bel-Air will give way to equally wealthy and leafy Pacific Pallisades with its own impressive estates. As you travel farther, you will begin a curving drive down to Pacific Coast Highway, the end of your drive, where you will see the white sands Santa Monica Bay and, beyond the sea, the sun set over the infinite horizon.

It's a small space, with a handful of rooms dedicated to serial killers, dead celebrities, and other morbid features. The news clips and photos of actual murders were a lot to handle, and I felt anxious going through each room. The only area that did not gross me out was a section highlighting how different cultures handle funerals (the examples they had on display were for Chinese, Jewish, and Mexican burials and it was interesting to learn about their processes). In the final stretch, there is an area set up to resemble a funeral home that also serves as a tribute to GG Allin (whom the owner is a very big fan of). I don't understand the appeal of it, but everyone has their interests.

Just go up the Canyon Drive all the way to the end you'll see you small parking lot on the left that serves about 15 cars. It also says Hollywoodland Park. As you come up Canyon Drive the signs say Park Road Closed Ahead, pay no attention, to these unless it is the middle of the night. If you come early and get a spot there then you walk back down Canyon Dr about 50 feet and you will set on the left (west) a dirt road that leads up the hill. Typically that gate is shut to stop cars. You can walk around the gate easily. On this day the gate was open. I thought how odd but I parked and walked up the dirt road anyway. As I continued up the road I noticed that there were so many fresh tire tracks. It was as if it was a heavily used dirt road. Then there were all these power cables laying on the ground, thick power cables. And a lot of them. I did not know what this meant . I walked on up the hill not very far, less than a quarter of a mile and around the corner there were lots of trucks. There were lots of things that looked like palm trees on the ground. There was stuff scattered everywhere. I had found the cave but what were all these people doing here? Well I asked somebody and a very friendly man named Ace told me that they had been shooting a movie here and they were just cleaning up all the stuff and closing down the set. It was a George Clooney movie Hail Caesar that had just been shooting some scenes here. So I took some pictures of them of the the set or what was left of it. Anyway I walked through the cave and found that from the back of the cave where it comes out there is a beautiful view of the Hollywood sign and the radio tower. The Hollywood sign is not visible from the front of the cave nor on the walkway up Canyon Dr. But, if you walk out the back of the cave you will find a beautiful view. How interesting the cave is not very long maybe a hundred to a hundred fifty feet, none the less and it is the famous Batcave. That was my original motivation. To walk up there to say yes I had been to the Batcave. Well I have now completed that mission and one of the beautiful things about exploring new places is you have to go there. You have to be at the location where it happened. You have to show up. And you never know who or what you're going to run into. What a lovely experience it was for me today. Hope you're so lucky when you go to the Bronson Caves. Check out the filmography on Wikipedia and you will find a very long list of shows and movies shot at this location, called arguably one of the most use movies sets in Los Angeles."},{"review":"Yes, we wanted to see the H'wood sign on our first visit to LA... we parked in Bronson Canyon-Griffith Park lot, took a short hike to caves used in some TV & movies (The batcave!), and as you come out of the cave, BAM, POW! There is the Hollywood sign on cue!"},{"review":"It's a short hike up a sloping hill to reach this cave, and well worth the effort made to get here. If you ever watched the original Batman TV series, you'll recognize the cave instantly. I could visualize Adam West roaring out of the cave in his Batmobile, Robin at his side- really fun to see this place. When you walk through the cave, the other side offers a wonderful view of the Hollywood sign. \nThe LA area hasn't had much rain so it's a very dry and dusty hike - not difficult but I think it would be hard on a very hot day. We went around 9:00 AM and it was lovely and peaceful- we were almost the only ones there."}],"streetAddress":"West side of Griffith Park, end of Canyon Drive","postalCode":"90026","name":"Bronson Caves","rating":"4.0","phonenumber":" Ranger Station","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

At the very top area of the park, there are several pieces of built-in outdoor exercise equipment and some amazing views of the city. A day at this park is well worth the visit."},{"review":"I love this park, great quick hike, nothing too strenuous, but you feel like you got a quick workout.

It wasn't much back then, and I ignored it for a long time. I recently went with my daughter and her husband and was astounded at the changes, all for the better. The park is built on old oil fields and keeps growing as the old wells are shut down and cleaned up. The land is returned to the community and the park grows. It's not a world class park yet but it's on it's way if public officials keep it moving forward. It could rival Griffith Park in the future. It has very nice hiking trails and some nice gardens. There are also kids' places and a fishing pond. Most of all it has spectacular views of Los Angeles.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This is my favorite natural history museum and I've been to ones in Seattle, San Diego, DC, Pittsburg, Chicago and Milwaukee to name a few. It took hours to get through it and every exhibit was even more interesting than the next. The gardens are beautiful and so nice to walk through as well. My three year old loved it so much he threw himself on the ground and sobbed when we had to leave as closing time rolled around. He wanted to live there. One of my favorite features is the beautiful stained glasses dome in the rotunda. It's a visually stunning sight to behold! They have plenty of dinosaur bones to keep your little paleontologist happy, but they also have live bug and spider displays and exhibits on the history of Los Angeles. We also went to the dinosaur puppet show they put on with giant almost life sized and realistic looking dinosaur puppets. My son thought it was great fun! Another bonus is we were given free admission with my military ID. I highly recommend going early and making a day out of it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"review":"Going up to LA for music at night and wanted to do something during the day. So glad we picked the museum. Was blown away by the dinosaur collection - the best we had ever seen and we have been to a few museums. If you like dinosaurs, you will be very impressed - I guarantee it. Price was good and we decided to pay extra for the Mummy exhibit (goes on thru Jan 16). Mummies from Peru & Egypt. Very interesting - glad we went but had mixed feelings about how we felt about digging up gravesites.\n\nWe were there for 6 hours and did not see it all - will definitely go back. So much to see - dinosaurs, insects, local stuff, rocks & gems, butterflies (seasonal), African mammals, North American mammals and some incredible artifacts from mexico, central and south america and so much more. Had hands on exhibits for kids. They have a cafe but we did not try the food.\n\nLocated by USC, public transportation can get you close or if you drive there is a pay parking lot right next to it. We will definitely go back and check out all the stuff we missed (need to spend more time at the hopi fetish collection). What are you waiting for? stop reading and go there now - you deserve it!"},{"review":"After visiting the Science Museum I ran across the plaza to the Natural History Museum. It was after 4pm so I was able to get discounted entry. The dinosaur exhibition was may main target and it was more exceptional than I anticipated. This time of day was fantastic as it was not very busy and I was able to stay until closing and get photos without anyone in the room. The attendants were really friendly and chatty. The museum is beautifully maintained and well worth a visit."},{"review":"I love museums, and this one is great! Easily accessible via the train. The dinosaur hall was one of the best ones I've seen next to the one in New York. Great exhibits and nice staff too. Definitely worth a visit."},{"review":"Located near the Science Museum, this is another gem you should visit. While not as comprehensive as New York or Chicago, it is an excellent choice in our area. Typical of other Museums of Natural History, you will see everything from dinosaur bones to gems.

The Endeavor exhibit was wonderful with intersting videos and displays. The rest of the museum was fullnof interactive exhibits that were fun and engaging for sdults and kids, we spent about 3 hrs exploring. The ocean exhibits were exceptionally good. Would probably have given it 5 stars, but there were a fair number of the interactive exhibits off line for repairs."},{"review":"(Spanish below) They have a variety of excellent exhibitions that are educational and interesting to the whole family. The African and North American Mammals exhibitions are our favorite. The halls have habitat dioramas that recreate the natural environment of the animals in the exhibit. The animals look so real and is like having and eye-to-eye experience with the animals in the wild. My sons love it and we spend at least an hour there observing the animals and sometimes my sons sketch them. Another great area is the Natural Lab which is an interactive area where you can experience facts, exhibits and even live animals that live in the L.A. area. There you can explore and play to be a scientist. For those that like dinosaurs, there is a large new exhibit that is very interesting with computerized, interactive technology. I don't think I have enough space to share everything about this museum. The rose garden is wonderful! They also have an insect, spider and butterfly exhibits! You have to go and enjoy it! They also have an excellent program for homeschoolers several times a year."},{"review":"The main reason we came all the way from San Diego was because they have so much more dinosaurs displayed and many other things. It was awesome! My child enjoyed everything that was in this museum, we all did. They even had a dinosaur show. It's worth the time and trip!."},{"review":"This was one of the best Natural History Museums I have been to. We only had 3 hours to spend there, but could have gone on longer. Just about every single exhibit was spectacular - the mummy exhibit, the most impressive huge and life-like dioramas I have seen anywhere, the dinosaur exhibit. The only exhibit that was less than fabulous was the spider exhibit, which had replaced the butterfly exhibit. There were very few spiders to be spotted, and none were much different than the ones you would see in your own home. I had just expected something more. But the rest of the Museum more than made up for that one slight disappointment. We had a wonderful guide for our tour, but unfortunately I have forgotten her name.

You can get some frozen yogart and a fatburger two blocks away"},{"review":"Growing up in LA, I remember well the trip we took with my Aunt to Bullocks in LA. At the time, I was so excited to be going to this iconic Bullocks. So for me, seeing the building brings back good memories. We would go to the top floor tea room and have lunch. It was quite an outing.\n\nToday, the department store no longer exists as they went bankrupt in 1992, but the art deco building still exists.. So for me its a special building in LA. It brings back special memories.\n\nFor those who like art deco type buildings, its very good. For others its probably just average now. I debated rating it average or very good, but given my memories rated it very good. Please realize that is a personal rating based on past experiences.\n\nToday the Southwestern Law School is there so unless you want to go there or attend the school there, its not as special to the general public as it once was."},{"review":"This was once THE carriage trade specialty store of Los Angeles, and the first designed with the automobile in mind, with the main entrance being from a motor court. Seriously trashed during the L.A. riots, then seriously stripped by soul-free Macy's. Now a law school. Can be visited once per year. Go. And boycott Macy's!"},{"review":"I signed up for the tour of this great building after talking with staff regarding the once-a-year open house and I found the experience to be very interesting and informative. Though some aspects of the décor had to be changed for the purposes of making the building a law school (as part of SW Law\u2019s campus expansion in 1994) there is enough Art Deco vibe still there to make for an eye-opening visit. I spent a good 90 minutes walking around and taking pictures. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. I would recommend attending the open house to anyone who has the least bit of interest in either architecture or L.A. history.\n\nDefinitely get a brochure\/map upon entering and follow the self-guided route. The 30 numbered \u201Cstops\u201D in the building are clearly marked and contain info that includes archival photos and\/or a description of what a particular room\/area was used for during the Bullocks days. Staff members are located in various places to answer questions as you walk through the building. The walking route depicted in the map goes from Floor 1, then 2, then 5, where most of the interesting things are. I recommend going in that order to maintain continuity, after which you can check out Floors 3 & 4 if you have extra time. These floors are of mild interest compared to the others and there are no numbered stops or staff there.\n\nFor your consideration:\n(1) The open house and corresponding self-guided tour happens one day a year, so it\u2019s best to get your name on the mailing list so as not to miss the next opportunity to go inside. Just call and make a reservation for what time you want to arrive. Fee = $25.\n(2) Enter the parking lot (free) from Wilshire Place just north of 7th Street. I was there on a Sunday and indicated to the parking attendant that I was there for the tour. He pointed out the correct ramp to take to get to the parking area.\n(3) Before going in stand in the Porte Cochère and look straight up to view the ceiling fresco dedicated to transportation (circa 1929)."}],"streetAddress":"3050 Wilshire Blvd","postalCode":"90010","name":"Bullocks Wilshire Building","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" +1 213 738 8240","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

Unfortunately the Hammer can be overlooked due to the relatively close proximity of LACMA, MOCA, The Gettyet al. This is gem of a museum that art lovers should not miss.

As literature states - The Hammer is free for good, issuing a declaration of a destination full of thought and double entendre. There is always something of wonder and intelligence at The Hammer, finding you leaving a better person - now that simply what art must be, should be about.

Lawren Harris is an artist considered to be an national treasure in Canada, but his work is mostly unknown in the US.

Don't wait too long because the exhibit is in LA only until January 24th. It's free to go to the museum and parking is easy and validated. While there, we had a great lunch in the cafe. It certainly wasn't free like the museum but the food was interesting and delicious and the service was good.

I grew up in Los Angeles and remember my mother driving by this mural on her way to the Sears Tower. The Folky, humorous art always made me smile.\n\nFor tourists headed from Los Angeles to Orange County to go to Knotts Berry Farm or Disneyland, this is a five minute excursion off the freeway while on your way. It is easy to find. Simply exit the 101\/5 freeway from south at Soto Street. Turn Right and head past the Sears Tower approximately 3 miles. It is in Vernon on the left hand side.\n\nThe mural basically depicts farm landscapes where you can see fields, trees, corn, barns, etc and of course, lots of pigs, big and small. Some of the pigs are happy and carefree, either laying in the grass, playing in the mud or with each other, flying airplanes, sleeping in hammocks and interacting with everyone from a buxom hill billy gal to keeping a boy company while he's fishing to pulling a wagon for a Gladiator wanna-be.\n\nOther pigs are trotting happily following a road and \"Farmer John\" signs to what they think is probably OZ, but is actually a smokehouse or a greased pig contest. A variety of other animals also grace this mural like dogs, chicks, quails, hawks, crows and probably even more that I may have missed this time around.\n\nIf you'd like to know the history of this mural, it basically goes like this. In 1957, Barney Clougherty, then owner of Farmer John, was approached by Les Grimes, a talented painter of scenic backgrounds for Hollywood movie sets, to decorate the outside of his building. With Barney's blessing, Grimes spent the next eleven years working on his \"masterpiece.\" Unfortunately, Grimes died in a fall from a fifty- foot scaffolding he was using to paint a portion of the sky on the mural. \n\nAfter Grimes' death, Clougherty hired Arno Jordan to finish the murals. Arno Jordan continued the legacy by painting new murals and restoring Grimes' originals. To noted art dealer Ivan C. Karp, the murals are \"a fundamental tract for West Coast vernacular painting.\" What's great about this mural is that it includes several gatefold plates of entire walls. Now that's some great detail. The plant was purchased by Hormel who intends to maintain the murals.\n\n\nIn 1964 Farmer John shifted to sponsorship of radio broadcasts of Dodger baseball games. This led to stadium sales of Farmer John's famous \"Dodger Dogs.\" However, the extra-long wieners did not become the Dodgers' official hot dog until around 1990. Dodger Stadium sold about two million of the \"eastern grown, western flavored\" wieners a year. In 1999, the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council ranked Dodger fans as baseball's top consumers of hot dogs. Famed sportscaster Vin Scully pitched Dodger Dogs to great effect in his broadcasts. Clougherty also supplied other area sports venues, including the Rose Bowl Coliseum. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND THE PIG DRESSED LIKE A DODGER ON THE MURAL.\n\n3049 E.

If you've ever seen, read or done any research into slaughter houses you'd know how horribly inhumane and cruel they are.

Being it was a Sunday, street parking was free! (Score!).

There was a Starbucks next to my parking spot, and a Subway next door to the 24 Hr Fitness and a sushi joint next door to that. We went for sushi and made it to the Wiltern with 10 minutes before doors opened. \n\nNote: There is a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf located literally across the street from the Wiltern as well.\n\nWhile walking to the venue, I saw the line literally wrapped around the corner of the block! Fortunately for me, I had VIP tickets, which I assumed meant I didn't have to queue in the main line. I was right! We had a special line at the front, which had maybe 10 people deep. We got in, but unfortunately still had to wait for the theater doors to the seats to open.\n\nMinus one star:\nThe Wiltern staff was not very organized, and didn't know what to do with VIP ticket holders like me as I thought I was entitled to special swag, etc. as promised on the Live Nation ticket site. I didn't want to get riled up over staff incompetence, so I hope the promoter will be sending me the swag. I got great seats and was bump to the front, that was pretty cool there.. although I thought VIP would mean earlier access to the venue.\n\nSouvenirs:\nBuy your stuff before the show. As we left, there were lots of stuff sold out. They take cash and charge, but the charge machine is slow. There's scalpers outside the venue after the show if you want knock off stuff.\n\nWristbands if you plan on drinking:\nWe didn't plan on drinking, so we skipped the wristband check. Drinks, I heard, were not cheap! Plan on spending money.\n\nWhile waiting in our seats, a girl came to take drink orders, so I got us 2 sodas (in a plastic 16 oz party cup) which came to $7, which I guess would be ouch if it were anyplace but a concert venue. \n\nOverall experience:\nIt was a great show. 2 hours of nostalgic songs by one of the influential British Invasion band in the 80s. \n\nFormer KROQ DJ Richard Blade warmed the crowd with trivia, and the show started at 8:45, and was also streamed live on Yahoo! screen.yahoo.com\/live\/ev\u2026\n\nWhen the show was over, the crowd dissipated quite quickly, and it was so easy to get to our car and leave.\n\nAn EXCELLENT evening for 2 girls reminiscing about our High School days, and remembering it was 30 years ago we last saw this band."},{"review":"I took my daughter to see Tween Sensation Shawn Mendes on 11\/26\/14. Sold out concert full of screaming girls. At the last moment I checked Twitter and The Wiltern had an Underground Package for sale. For only $40 per person you get your very own parking spot underneath The Wiltern, you get escorted to the VIP Lounge to wait until seating and have a Complimentary Beverage and Snack and a Laminated Lanyard Memento. The Staff at The Wiltern is Amazing! Siliva arranged for the Underground parking, The parking attendants are friendly and helpful with my bad attempt to park LOL. Olivia escorted us in and gave us a quick tour, bathrooms, lounge area and answered everyones question with friendly enthusiasm (and we avoided the long line outside in the cold to get in and $20 Ralphs parking). The Wiltern has EXCELLENT ACOUSTICS and is beautiful inside. The ushers and security people are friendly and approachable\/helpful. This was our first visit to The Wiltern and it was PERFECT!

I saw one of the same bartenders from the House Of Blues, so that made it extra special! \nThe architecture of the building is interesting enough to make you want to thoroughly scour its nooks and crannies for hidden treasures. And skip the concert altogether. \nI was able to get in the VIP section(for free) after going in, and that was amazing. What I don't understand is how anybody could be sitting down during the concert! Why go to a beautiful theatre to listen to a rock band, to sit down? \nThe drinks are pricey(of course)and mostly water, so I recommend stopping at The Beer Belly down the street for food and cheaper libations. \nThe hidden little bar downstairs is very chic and worth the climb down.

The collections displayed are VERY limited right now. There is one room where the perimeter has a nice pottery timeline displayed. Otherwise, the tunnel is empty, and there are no baskets on display AT ALL. Since that is there specialty, I'd advise waiting for the renovations to be complete before visiting."},{"review":"This museum was grand and beautiful 8-10 years ago. Apparently, the building structure began to deteriorate and water began to leak in putting all of the artifacts at risk. With no money to repair, the Gene Autry Museum stepped in and bought the artifacts and appear to be displaying or housing the artifacts. Now The Southwest Museum is mostly an empty building, while they see how to preserve the beautiful icon. So sad. You can now cover the museum in 10 minutes with only a little bit of pottery being displayed."},{"review":"There must be a complicated back-story, but this museum is definitely not worth a visit. As an occasional LA visitor from back East, I looked forward to visiting this museum during the years it was closed for renovation. Now only open on Saturday, it is a very big disappointment. There's not much to see, and you don't come away having learned anything. You have the feeling this must be a tax dodge for wealthy patrons who get together and give themselves parties, but this may be too cruel. I just can't understand what's going on. If they have anything worthy of display but can't figure out how to so it, they ought to divvy the stuff up among the Smithsonian and other public institutions, and just go out of business. This is a beautiful site with nothing in it."},{"review":"The Southwest Museum, Los Angeles' oldest museum housed one of the most extensive collections of Native American artifacts. It was and is a beautiful edifice. I can remember going there with my children and viewing amazing artifacts from across the Southwest.\n\nToday it is the unfortunate victim of reconstruction and refurbishment that leaves a billion dollar collection in boxes, some of it carted away to the Autry Museum and much of it in boxes stored in two yet to be \"galleries\" and storage rooms.It appears that Autry maintains control of it and has greatly diminished its offerings.\n\nIt's odd that the museum was \"reopened\" with virtually nothing to show to the public. You can walk in through the upper entrance look through locked doors at the two closed galleries with boxes piled high, serving as storerooms, and go downstairs to the lovely reception area ...with no artifacts. Then some more stairs leads to ...the bathrooms, with no more than a handful of artifacts in cases along the way.\n\nThe guard advised that the first gallery will open in Dec 2012 or Jan 2013, and the second, sometime after that. However I cannot imagine that these two, what seem to me as, over-built galleries could possibly do justice to a billion dollar collection.\n\nI don't know why the Southwest has allowed to fall into this derelict condition, with absolutely none of it's former grandeur ...that is unless an air conditioned edifice qualifies as a museum, which it does not. ...And let me be clear, the edifice is beautiful, but I believe, even in design, with insufficient space for the collection. ...The museum board and management has done a terrible disservice to the community and what was once a Los Angeles landmark."},{"review":"The first museum in Los Angeles was started in 1907. This structure was built in 1913-14 and is a National Historic Building. There are examples of pottery by the American Indians dating from the 14th century. It is now part of the Autry National Center and much of the artifacts have been moved to another location. The museum is free and you can expect to spend about an hour perusing the collection. There is also a native garden. Many people who expect a full museum would be disappointed at the smallness of this one.

There are several room with exhibits of the heavens and hand on displays for visitors to play with. During an eclipse, the Observatory is filled with astronomy enthusiasts.

Firstly the cost is high in comparison with the Getty Centre and Villa where you pay $15 for parking and can visit both venues for free. LACMA is $25 for entrance to the museum and special exhibitions and $12 for parking. The exhibition spaces looked dirty and tired and most rooms didn't have anyone watching them. I felt quite stressed while walking around as it was very hard to navigate from the poor map diagram that had been provided at the entrance. I asked an attendant why there was no signage anywhere to direct you to the various sections of the Museum (or even the exits) and they advised me that the Museum Director does not believe in wayfinding signage. Apparently you are supposed to just discover the art and feel your way around. I found it frustrating and annoying as many of the rooms were the same colour and it was hard to work out whether you had seen everything or were actually just going in circles. It was not an enjoyable experience for me and the attendants were grumpy too probably from the many frustrated people asking them for directions. I was also told off for taking a photo in a section which apparently was a special private exhibition but again there was no sign to identify this differentiation. The exhibition itself has some high points but in my opinion the curation was jumbled. I far prefer the Getty Centre which had a simple chronological order from start to end.

Just how they have set up interesting outdoor pieces (free to look at) is a great introduction to what follows inside. The areas that hold different periods and styles of art are well marked and allow the visitor to choose what to tackle. I say this as the centre is quite extensive and, for maximum benefit, should be tackled in small doses. Trying to take it all in in one day could be exhausting. While we had plenty of highlights (including the Gehry exhibition while we were there), there is something for everyone so I won't try and play favourites.

The Gateway Plaza Fanfare Fountains were located far away in an area where there was room for maybe 20 cars, most of which had to park on the street, and there were children wading in it in between shows like it was some kind of pool.

One case houses models of planes that he painstakingly built, they are exquisite and perfect down to every little detail.\n\nThere is no charge for the museum, but they do accept donations.

It's absolutely great! So very good that it is WELL worth a donation of anything you feel like contributing.\n\nWife and I spent a couple of hours here, one afternoon, and found such a wealth of interesting photos, clothing, absolutely superb scale model planes and other memorabilia that we brought her Mom back the next day and she enjoyed it every bit as much as we did! There is something of interest for almost everyone, not least a wide ranging view of current air-plane activity in and out of LAX, on whose land this \"Museum\" stands. All greatly enhanced by cheerfully enthusiastic 'docents' of both genders, who all seem to have been deeply involved with planes or airlines for years and years.\n\nIt's much bigger than it first seems and it was only towards the end of our second visit that I discovered the aero-space area and then yet another area where a retired pilot was expertly demonstrating flight simulations on a computer. Like everyone else there, he was enthusiastically forthcoming about what he used to do (fly planes of course!) and what he does now, which is train would-be pilots to a high standard of proficiency using the several PCs in this room. There's no age limit on this course and, without a doubt, I'm going to sign up for one of his flight sim courses next time I'm in LA. I can hardly wait! :-)"},{"review":"Just cannot be in this area and not pay a visit to this Museum. It is still a \"must\" for us. This time, we took our son along.

There's a huge Russian cargo plane parked right next door to the Museum now, and it was exciting to see it. Since last year, they have received new donations, and extended the Museum by opening more rooms. We watched the videos again, admired the lovely vintage flight attendant uniforms, and looked through all the display cases. \n\nThe volunteers here are incredible as they are so knowledgeable, and so very interesting.

They have a restaurant that sells mexican\/indian fusion food."},{"review":"We went to see Veruca Salt here and if I knew what was in for us, I might have reconsidered. First of all, the parking situation is completely stupid! No one in the area would honor El Rey parking, even though it said on the El Rey website that the big bldg. on the corner and other parking structures would. Everywhere I went, signs were posted stating that El Rey parking would not be honored! The only little lot that you could pay and park, allowed just 2 hours and would end at 7 or 8 p.m.! After that, you would need a city permit to park there! Of course, El Rey valet parking does not start until one hour before the venue opens! I ended up wasting $5 in order to kill time for the valet to open. They must do that in order to trap you into paying for the valet out of desperation! Trust me, it works! Jerks. When we finally were let in, I ran to get a spot in front of the stage and did. I have always liked the interior decor of the El Rey. An ocean of red suede with the theater logo projected on the stage curtain. Very plush. Unfortunately, no seats on the sides for those who want to sit and the balcony is WAY back in the rear. The acoustics were not bad and the stage is not too high to look over. Lighting was good too. On a personal note, there was a larger than normal LGBT crowd present. I have NO problem with this community, but we had MANY drunk lesbians around us in front of the stage and they were all over us literally! They would not leave us alone and kept touching us and prying into our conversations for an hour and a half! A LOT of sexual inuendo! It creeped out my date and generally was unpleasant! The show finally started and the three bands were great. I even got the most prized set list. We then exited and went to the valet. As expected, it took forever to get our car. Then the lesbians followed us out to the front where we were waiting and were drunkenly all over us again. They were waiting for their car too. Aside from that, the venue was okay, but I was not overenthusiastic about it. I have also noticed over the years that the El Rey Theater never has any good bands that I would want to go see. Therefore, that effects my overall rating of it.

Sometimes the times listed for the headliners are not accurate. When I bought my tickets it said 8:00. Then, when printed they said 9:00. The website said the doors open at 7:00. The headliner didn't come on stage until 10:15. There are about 500 seats. After that you are standing. Bars are very reasonable. Almost no bad seats in the house. Just go prepared, and with a full phone battery. :-)"},{"review":"Recently attended small concert (Fink and Douglas Dare), but not our first event at this venue.

The ship models and small ships lining the walkway to the second floor were also outstanding. The second floor has an interactive hands on children's section among the other displays of maritime navigation, communication, and marine relics.

There is an exhibit inside the main center that includes information about all the missions, plus some cool displays (including one on the toilets aboard the Space Shuttle).

Looking up at this immense space craft and being able to see the thousands of little tiles that cover it was truly an experience.

Glad the rental had a rail mount, it ended up making it a heck of a lot easier to balance and reel in the line later!\n\nMy only complaint was that the website says the trip is $50, but when I got there they charged me $55. When I asked the lady at the window, she's like yeah they upped the price cause.. and kind of trailed off and I still have no idea why they upped the price.\n\nWe had 31 anglers on board and we were doomed with sand dab fishing approximately 300 feet below. The two deckhands (Chris and ??) were great. They were constantly waiting to fix the next tangle and quick to help as needed. They were also working the galley and eager to cook something up for anyone who asked. Very friendly folks, really on the ball for everything.\n\nOverall, on fishing alone--well worth it. You will get a ton of sand dab if you have the patience and strength to fish for it. These guys definitely know where to go! The deckhands are amazing and ready to help anyone out. My only complaint, as said, was the $5 price increase at the window--otherwise, check it out sometime! It's pretty fun catching 9 fish at a time! ;)\n\nAnd a note to those who have not fished before:\nYou will be expected to pay for tackle: hooks, line, weights especially if you are renting a rod. However, the tackle that is sold in the shop providing the sportfishing, should set you up with the CORRECT tackle and have you pay for it. You will not be able to return anything at the end of the day, used or not. If you ever plan on fishing again, plan to bring it on your return trip. Iron (weights) are NOT cheap, and people will lose them to snagged rocks, etc. which is why they are not provided to you, free. This is the same with every sportfishing company, or they would lose money. You can always bring your own gunny sack, and your own everything and not have to pay to use theirs."},{"review":"First time fishing with this company. Went on the boat \"the pursuit\". Check in went well. Payed $65. Had to rent polls ($15 each) and tackle and we were told by the employee which weights and hooks we would need to buy from him. $50 later we got onto the boat. Deckhands were helpful, boat was nice. Didn't see the captain much, which was fine. Deckhand helped tie knots for our hooks and such, he told us we didnt buy the correct size weights and we could buy the correct ones from him. We did for $3 a weight, which seemed a bit much. Didn't realize a place to store your fish during the trip was going to cost also. $2 each bag to buy on boat. Fished all day. At the end, they offered to filet the fish and after finishing said it was $25, eeek! The past charter boats ive been on always did this for free. At the end of the day we went to return the polls and ask if you could return the weight they said we needed and didn't use, they would not return them for us even though they were still in the plastic. All in all, it was ok. Just be careful because they charge for every single little thing."},{"review":"I went with four other coworkers during Fathers Day week . They offered a $20 discount if booked online. Even with the discount the boat was not crowded.

The captain really tries to put you on fish. Great deck hands.\nThe Cons: slow boat, it took nearly three hours to get to the backside of Catalina from San Pedro, including a stop at the bait barge.

Highly recommended"},{"review":"Located in a former LAPD police precinct, this museum has two floors of exhibits and a rear parking area with several police vehicles and a retired LAPD Bell Jetranger helicopter you can sit in for photo ops.\n\n The exhibits include items, photos and weapons from major LAPD investigations including the SLA (remember Patty Hearst?), the onion field murder (made famous by the Joseph Wambaugh book) and an excellent exhibit detailing the North Hollywood Bank shootout which injured multiple officers. Parked in the outside lot are three vehicles from this incident with bullet holes. As the building was once a working police station, visitors can explore the front desk, and jail cells which once held suspects.\nOther exhibits show the evolution of handcuff technology, uniforms worn over the years by the department, badges, the role of reserve officers.\n\nThe museum appears to be a work in progress (rooms closed with other items in storage) with possible additional exhibits forthcoming so it will be interesting to see what is added in the future. I admire the effort, apparently by volunteers, that has gone into this museum, as the LAPD is one of the largest police forces with a long history which needs to be shared. Couple that with the department frequently being featured in the TV and movie industry and this attraction needs to be on your must see list.\n\n I would estimate that 3 hours would be ample time to see most everything (but I am the type of person who likes to see and read each exhibit). Make sure not to miss Jack Webb's checked sport coat from the Dragnet TV series hanging framed on a wall on the first floor.\n\nWith the admission fee (9$ adults, under 12 free) you are provided with a audio guided tour which provides a lot of the details.\n\nThere is ample free parking off street for visitors, it is on a bus line, but some distance from Metro rail. There is a small gift shop with challenge coins, t-shirts and other LAPD merchandise."},{"review":"I spent almost an hour at the museum and it captivated me from start to finish. I liked all the police vehicles and the various exhibits on the 3rd floor. In particular the exhibit on the 1997 North Hollywood shootout highlights how dangerous policing is and the bravery exhibited by the LAPD in bringing down two heavily armed bank robbers.

The new police station opened in April 1926, and the official opening was attended by then Chief, Edgar Davis and Police Commissioners, Birnbaum, Insley and Webster. \n\n** \u201CDid you know\u2026\u2026,\u201D that in 1942, future LAPD Chief Daryl Gates was arrested and briefly held at this station for \u201Cassault and battery on an officer!\u201D In 1963, he returned as a police captain in command of the station.\n\nA number of \u201Chigh profile\u201D cases were handled out of this station; \"Hillside Stranglers\", Angelo Buono, Jr. and the Kenneth Bianchi case. The radical Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), the group that kidnapped Patty Hearst and engaged in an infamous shootout with the LAPD in 1974. In 1973, they planted a bomb at this station but it proved to be a \u201Cdud.\u201D\n\nIn the early 1980s, the building was cited for being unsafe and failed to meet seismic safety standards and closed in 1983. The vacant building was set for demolition until the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission declared it a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #274) in January 1984. Two months later (Mar 84), the building was added to the National Register of Historic Buildings. The station is now operated as the \u201CLos Angeles Police Museum.\u201D\n\nThis museum is a self-guided tour and on display is the \u201Cholding cells\u201D along with the way a police stationed looked like for that time period.

Eleven police officers and seven civilians were injured, and both robbers were killed. There were numerous vehicles and private property damaged or destroyed by the nearly 2,000 rounds of ammunition fired by both sides. \n\n\u2022 Due to the large number of injuries, rounds fired, weapons used, and overall lengthy shootout, it is regarded as one of the longest and bloodiest events in US police history.\n\nThe museum is open Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and the third Saturday of each month from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nOur visit;\nI think I was just as enthusiastic as my kids were in coming to visit this place.

The one incident that most stands out in my mind is the \u201CNorth Hollywood Shootout.\u201D I remember watching this live on TV and was glued as I watched the firefight taking place between the \"two bank robbers and almost all of LAPD!\" \n\nIt was hard to watch as civilians and officers went down and with live coverage, you saw the blood all over the place. The ending was the most dramatic as \u201CSWAT officers\u201D exchanged fire with the lone gunman and eventually took him into custody. The suspect died shortly thereafter on scene. I still have vivid memories of the whole incident! \n\nThe museum had on display and encased in glass, the life size manikins of the two heavily armed robbers and a video tape of the actual shootout. Vehicles outside of the museum included a shot-up police vehicle, armored vehicle, and a helicopter, used during this incident. \n\nI recalled this incident changed the way police officers responded to future shootouts. Before, regular patrol officers only had their sidearm and shotgun at their disposal and had to wait for SWAT to arrive for the firepower. Today, officers are equipped with the latest AR-15\u2019s to match the suspect\u2019s firepower.\n\nMy family enjoyed all the props and items at this museum and upstairs, sat and watched the actual North Hollywood Shootout. While they watched the documentary, I enjoyed reading and looking at all the uniforms and other things they had displayed. \n\nOn the humorous side, the museum also displayed \u201CID Cards\u201D from the widely popular 60\u2019s Detective TV Series, \u201CDragnet\u201D which featured a \u201Ctrue\u201D story every week. Det. Joe Friday & Gannon's police identifications they \u201Cflashed\u201D on the show was on display (Uploaded to YELP).\n\nCan\u2019t say enough how much I enjoyed seeing this museum and I think the kids liked it too! Our family left learning a lot more about police work along with memories of this trip here!"},{"review":"We visited the museum while on a road trip of the southwest and west coast. My wife and I are both retired police officers, and have visited a few other police museums over the years. The museum is located in an old police station. Many of the displays are photographs, but there were nice displays of uniforms and equipment, including weapons. There were 3 main exhibits; Patty Hearst, The Onion Field police officer murder, and the North Hollywood bank shootout. \n\nA lot behind the museum held old police vehicles and a helicopter. There were also a few cars from the bank shootout. The only criticism I have is that the labeling on the exhibits could be better, as many were typewritten cards or yellowing pieces of paper. These could be updated very nice with today,s computers and printers. \n\nWe visited on a very hot day, and the museum has no AC, so it was really hot, especially on the upper floors. Overall though a very nice museum, with a lot of potential."},{"review":"This museum gives you lots of history of the LA Police Department. It's located in a former police precinct building. They even have old police vehicles and a helicopter you can sit in. The actual police car and criminals car from the famous Bank of America Shoot Out are on display too. There is a nice display of memorabilia from the actual robbery. Make sure you watch the video of the shootout too. The old jail cells are as they were back in the day. You can go inside them and get a taste of what it's like to be a criminal.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"How in the world do you get to Upper Las Virgenes Open Space Reserve? How do you tell someone about it? Two words: Ahmanson Ranch. Is that the correct name? No. Not really but, it rolls off the tongue more easily. \n\nSo... What can you do there? Hike, mountain bike, walk your dog (on a leash only,) bird watch, bring the kids and see some scenic California views as well as sweeping panoramas of the San Fernando Valley. There is currently no wheel chair access and only a pit toilet comfort station (at the Victory Blvd. Trail Head.) There is a rich history, however and it's been the scene of many a film shoot and commercial location. \n\nAccess can be made through two basic points where ample parking exists (although many lesser known trails and access points also provide entry.) \n\nVICTORY TRAIL HEAD: You can enter most easily and directly by following Victory Blvd, west, until you reach the very end. The parking area will be obvious and you are encouraged to use it. Here is where you'll want to park if you're towing a horse trailer. The self-paid gravel parking lot happens to boast the LOWEST PARKING FEES in the state. This is to help reduce the number of people parking in the surrounding residential areas to avoid paying any fees. (C'mon. Really? It's $3! That's dirt cheap!) \n\nLAS VIRGENES TRAIL HEAD: An alternative way to access the park is from the 101 Freeway, exiting at the Las Virgenes exit and turning north on Las Virgenes to follow that to the end. While not an official parking lot, there are limited places to park for free to access the property. No bathrooms or wheel chair access exist here, so be forewarned. \n\nVAN OWEN AVENUE\/EL SCORPION PARK: \nJust off the west end of Van Owen Avenue, another access point exists with very limited parking. This area is known to locals as El Scorpion Park. \n\nEach of these three points offers access to certain park features. Car access to the actual Ahmanson Ranch House does exist but it is strictly limited to use only during special events and weddings which take place at the otherwise off-limits, property.\n\nSeasons here bring interesting changes to the area and there is never really a bad time to come unless it is raining. In winter, there are many good days to hike or bike on the surrounding trails with cool, mild temps. Any season rainfall makes the hills green up instantly making for a scenic landscape or backdrop for a day outdoors. Spring, brings green, rolling hills and deep blue skies filled with birds and wildflowers can be found along the Las Virgenes and Bell Canyon fire roads. Summer turns the green into a golden, sun drenched savannah dotted with by the occasional oak tree. The heat can be excessive here in summer and you\u2019ll want to prepare by bringing plenty of water. I have seen kites, owls, red-tailed hawks and many other amazing animals throughout the seasons. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll see deer grazing from the panoramic views surrounding Laskey Mesa or maybe even a coyote or two as they leap and dive to root for field mice. I\u2019ve also encountered rabbits, rattle snakes, tarantulas and the iridescent blue wasp called, tarantula hawk here, as well. But don\u2019t worry. Spotting these inhabitants is a rare and unusual treat. Just use caution, stay on designated trails and keep your dogs leashed for their own safety.\n\nFire roads and foot trails zig-zag and meander throughout the property allowing multi-use for horses, mountain bikes and hikers. No motorized vehicles of any kind are allowed. Commercial photography and filming require a permit. Views of the greater San Fernando Valley can be had from certain vantage points throughout the park. Because the park is located near many homes, there are many people walking dogs. Dogs should be leashed here at all times. There are also trails closed to all traffic. Please respect signs and fences that mark these restoration areas and territories. \n\nMost importantly, this open space is a tremendous classroom. Visit at any age. Even if you don\u2019t stroll deep into the park property, there is plenty to see at each point of access. Equestrian visitor already know many of this areas hidden secrets but if you are an experienced hiker or mountain biker, and are looking for a challenge, you can look at at any quality map of the Simi Hills area to see how this park connects to Cheeseboro\/Palo Commado Canyons National Park. Getting there from say, the Victory trail head isn't far, depending on the trails you take, but there are steep climbs, creek crossings and a strong knowledge of the area is recommended. \n\nI can't stress enough that a few minutes of preparation can save hours of frustration - or worse. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, a hat. Dress in layers. Be prepared for weather (it's usually warmer here than other LA locations. Park in the designated parking lot and most importantly, tell somebody where you're going and when you expect to be back. It's hard to believe someone could truly be lost so close to an urban setting - but do it anyway."},{"review":"If you're the kind of person who likes a surprise around each corner, this is the trail for you.

(jeez); second, why the poor signage? It was very difficult for newbies to guess where new trails started, and I spent an uncomfortable amount of time feeling lost and not trusting where I was heading. Very, very easy to fix.

{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"I became familiar with the POP opera group through a brief evening performance of various company members at the Miles Theatre in Santa Monica. I was impressed. That evening they announced an upcoming performance of \"Carmen\" noting that the seating is either a single chair or small table format which sounded interesting. The tables were sold-out for a weekend night so I purchased (2) single seats at $20 apiece. The current venue is a theater in Highland Park near the 110 freeway or 1-1\/2 blocks from a light rail stop. There were about 100+ in attendance, the audience section was informal. The tables for either 2 or 4 came with a bottle of wine(there is a selection), water, and a nice size presentation of cheese, crackers, fresh fruit, salami, a cookie, etc. which was more than a snack and less than a meal. When the performance began it was apparent within minutes that this company offered a high level of quality and enthusiastic performers, a unique twist and staging of the story of \"Carmen\", a relaxed and cozy setting with decent acoustics, and excellent value for the ticket price. My guest and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire performance, appreciated the professional handling of the refreshment area( wine and non-alcoholic + small versions of the table food), the good sight line, the ease of coming and going i.e. parking, and the overall robust and fun evening. In fact, I went ahead and purchased a table for two for the May staging of \"La Calisto\". I was advised that currently they offer performances at this locale and another site in Los Angeles. It was terrific to see that the Opera culture was alive and well aside from the more formal, grand, and expensive offerings in the LA area."},{"review":"POP just completed its run of La Calisto, a reimagined 17th century opera telling the story of love, affairs and betrayal among the greek gods, and one human. The supertitles at times provide humorous non-literal translations, the scenery is modernized and edgy, and the story was presented in comedic fashion. The venue, the Ebell Club in Highland Park is intimate, though the chairs are uncomfortable, so bring cushions. The performance included a small live orchestra along with a large cast. This is a great bargain, with general admission seats for $20 and a table for four for $100, including wine and snacks. POP is a unique LA experience, and highly recommended."}],"streetAddress":"6216 Annan Way","postalCode":"90042","name":"Pacific Opera Project","rating":"5.0","phonenumber":" 323-739-6122","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA"},

There is also the J.Paul Getty Villa located in Malibu California on the Pacific Coast Highway.\nBecause of where the Getty Center sits, high above the City of Los Angeles, it commands a view from downtown Los Angeles over Hollywood, Mid Wilshire, West Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and then ending at Santa Monica and the Pacific ocean. The Center is constructed with architectural grace and beauty with it's exterior gleaming in white alabaster marble throughout the facility. With the Centers beautifully designed garden and talented artistic garden personnel, changing plants seasonally and with it's exquisite lawns, trees and shrubs. One can sit peacefully with the bustling city far below, The Getty Center can feel like you are in another country when it's just minutes away. But the other story is it's wonderful galleries and special exhibits scheduled throughout the year as well as special screenings held in the evenings. This is surely something every tourist and Angelo's should not miss for they will be missing one of L.A.'s most treasured sites all made possible free of charge from the J. Paul Getty Foundation."},{"review":"A haven in the midst of central LA. Off of the 5 it is a quiet tram ride to an oasis of viewing beautiful pieces of art. The views are inspiring. Landscaping is an added benefit. LA has much to offer but The Getty is a lifetime memory.

Will be back again on my next visit to California."},{"review":"Popped in to this place for a taste of home after being informed by a mate of mine. Tucked into a warehouse space on an unassuming side street I was pleasantly surprised. the staff was friendly, the place was packed, there was a great vibe and best of all the Ales were fantastic. Loved every single one I tried. They have a food truck that comes and sets up out front as well which is always a treat. Additionally they are ride off the Orange Line Metro Bike path which makes it a perfect stop on those long rides. They've started selling their beer in several pubs around LA however you can still get a Growler fill for a reasonable price. A True Gem! I will be frequenting regularly"},{"review":"We went on a Wednesday night and found a traditional no frills \nBritish brew pub tucked away in a warehouse on a dark nonresidential \nstreet in Van Nuys. The place was packed! Seating is limited to the bar, \nsome high chairs and a few tables of low chairs. On this night there was \na large unlikely knitting circle at one of the large low tables, and a knitting \ntruck out front. You can find some food at a food truck out front (next to \nthe knitting truck) or all the peanuts you can eat (just throw the shells\non the floor) or packages of crackers (for the cheese that you bring). \nYou can bring your own food of any kind but if you do, be prepared \nto bring everything you need to eat it. \n\nThe focus here is the traditionally brewed ale that comes in varying \ncolors and flavors. You can buy them in a pint, a half pint or a sampler. \nThey also have growlers, containers for take-away. The ale is served \nat a British temperature and has no added carbonation. You're getting \nthe real deal here and you'll meet ex-pat Brits, anglophiles and other \nale lovers. There are non-alcoholic sodas for the nondrinker in your party. \n\nIf you've never been to the UK and want to try traditional ale, \nthis is your place. \n\nAt least during these winter months you'll want to bring a jacket. \nIt's a warehouse so the whole front rolls up like a garage door \nand it can get chilly -- at least until you put away a few pints!"},{"review":"We came here on a whim and we had a great time. We tried a number of great beers and we took a growler home to share with others.

{"reviews":[{"review":"The homes are amazing, especially the Hale House. These homes were formerly in or adjacent to Bunker Hill, or environs like Pasadena, Lincoln Heights. Great photo ops too."},{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This place is a museum of wonderful old houses. It is a gem in a nasty neighborhood. The homes are well kept. You can travel back in time just by visiting this place."},{"review":"We found this attraction simply by going to the GPA and looking under Leisure and Attractions. I expected an old historic part of LA. We drove there and it was located in a so-so neighborhood. Initially we were going to leave. I didn't think my son would like it. However, I said to myself that I should see it now because we probably wouldn't return. It turned out to be great. It consists of several older house representing various time periods which have been moved to this small park. A tour guide took us through the houses and talked about the social aspects of life at the time the houses were built and also included artifacts such as an old icebox, etc. My son, who is interested in history, had to admit that he really enjoyed the tour. Our tour guide was named Rose and really made this a great experience. I fully recommend it."},{"review":"Allow about 2 hours for a wonderful docent tour of this Museum. You may recognize from several movies such as \"Saving Mr Banks\" and \"Legally Blond\". Period houses which are fascinating to explore. They also have a church and stable which you can only view from the outside. Old railway station where you buy tickets and has a gift shop. Best of all is a fully furnished Phamacy which a vast range of interesting items dating back to the last century. Easy acces off Highway 110. Highly recommend."},{"review":"I invited my friends for an afternoon at the Museum. The 6 of us enjoyed the tour very much. It was truly a treat, like going back to a time when things not only needed to be functional but pretty. There are many things we consider a modern day invention which are much older then people know. Great place to visit with friends, family and groups."},{"review":"We saw Heritage Square Museum from the highway the year ago decided that with visited on an extra to Los Angeles. We were not disappointed.\n\nHeritage Square has about 12 Victorian houses, an old Methodist Church and a wonderful drugstore. Not all of the houses have been refurbished, but you do get the opportunity to see a couple of the houses via a guided tour. The museum is only open at weekends, but well worth the visit. There is ample parking. We did not find the admission charge $10 as being expensive.\n\nPerhaps the most fascinating part of the tour was the drugstore. It certainly brought to life some of the scenes that we only see at the movies. I had no idea the reason why drinks was sold in a drugstore until I visited this particular parlour. While you waited for your concoction to be made, why not sample soda hot drink. Simple really. The drugstore is full of personal collection of memorabilia of the pharmaceutical industry. It's one of those places where you say, oh I remember them!\n\nTo the houses we used in the film \"Saving Mr Banks\".\n\nA wheelchair could disabled people be useful. It is a long walk from the entrance to the furthest exhibit, the drugstore."},{"review":"I took my mother here on Mother's Day. We thoroughly enjoyed the tour of several different style homes, structures, and the pharmacy at HS. The tour is leisurely, so if you're in a rush come when you can stroll and absorb the architecture and knowledge of the volunteers who run this gem!"},{"review":"Heartwarming to think in this town where everyone is for sale that there are sill people trying to preserve and celebrate Los Angeles before she was nothing more than the seat of the entertainment industry. This is the place to go to remember once upon a time LA was home to someone glad to live there and live the simple life. Go for one of their events, better yet, dress up and really enter into the spirit of things."},{"review":"Heritage Square has several Victorian houses & a pharmacy museum that you can go through on a guided tour. People who are into architecture or antiques would probably enjoy this museum. I was a little frustrated since the pace of the tour is slow, the phone message and the web site were not accurate on the hours of operation, and the houses are not that much different than what you would find in the eastern United States. The tour group seemed to come alive at the end of the tour, when we went into the pharmacy exhibit since most young people were totally unfamiliar with what pharmacies used to be like (soda bar with stools)."},{"review":"Collection of Victorian houses in LA - one wouldn't expect to find. This is a fairly extensive tour, and our docent was certainly enthusiastic; that is, he had his note cards well prepared. On specific items placed about the houses; well.... One house for instance had much 1930's furnishings, accessories and implements, which seemed to come as a complete surprise. Even the architectural review was a bit spotty if one knows these things. The odd thing to this easterner was the reverence accorded to very common everyday objects. Flea market finds in some cases, and we who actually live and use homes that are 125 years old as residences (I owned one that was 1888) find it odd to worry about a stray child touching the staircase bannister! Still, it's a nice introduction and if encourages people to take up an interest in history then mission accomplished."}],"streetAddress":"3800 Homer Street","name":"Heritage Square Museum","rating":"4.5","phonenumber":" 323-225-2700","addressLocality":"Los Angeles","addressRegion":"CA","operation":[{"days":"Fri - Sun","time":"12:00 pm - 4:00 pm"}]},
