    "desc": "Though slavery is prohibited everywhere, current estimates suggest there are between 20.9 and 35.8 people trapped in slavery and forced labour today, of which 5.5 million are children. Modern slavery affects societies and supply-chains worldwide, and ISIS and Boko Haram are openly promoting a return to slavery. \n In September 2015, UN Member States committed, in Sustainable Development Goal 8.7, to ?[t]ake immediate and effective measures to eradicate forced labour, end modern slavery and human trafficking?. To mark the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, UN University and the Freedom Fund will release two new policy reports reviewing multilateral efforts and proposing new measures to strengthen multilateral efforts to end modern slavery, forced labour and human trafficking.? \n For further information visit the event  webpage ."
