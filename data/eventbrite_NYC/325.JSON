    "desc": "For 21 years in a row, we've stuck our necks out and brought you one of the  biggest Jewish Singles events of the year  on Thanksgiving Eve! Not as big at  The Ball on Dec 24 ,  of course (the biggest Jewish event in the country for the past 20 years; details to be released shortly - expect something grand) but pretty cluckin' big! (Ok, it's hens that cluck and not turkeys but I'm winging it here). The 21st Annual Turkey Ball? will held at  Hudson Terrace's enclosed, heated and gorgeous rooftop  (Anytime you use the word rooftop in an event promotion, the word \"gorgeous\" must proceed it by operation of law, but it is a beautiful spot and, more importantly, a very comfortable venue for meeting new people)."
