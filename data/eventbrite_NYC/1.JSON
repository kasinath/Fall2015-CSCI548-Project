    "desc": "Class Description Intro to Paper Mach? is a class designed to allow kids to experience the fun of sculpture. It teaches children how to take a concept sketch and build it into a three-dimensional work of art. In addition, the class will feature elements of drawing, painting and of course getting their hands 'creatively' dirty with paper mach?. At the end of class, all students will be able to take home their sculpture.? All art will be made from recycled Whole Food bags. We are eco-conscious artists and don't waste anything!  Class schedule  Saturdays, December 5, 12 and 19 : 1:00pm-2:00pm. Teacher Profile Hello, My name is Sebastian Alappat and I'm the founder of SPARK. I was blessed as a child to be able to draw. I took that love and established myself as an Art Director and Creative Director. Putting aside my design hat, I longed to create art again with my hands. As an artist, I sought to find a way to cultivate the inner artists that are in all children. I love working with kids . Through a completely unique curriculum I have been able to teach drawing, painting and sculpture to many kids through private and group classes. If you want your kids to learn art and be inspired from a fun, passionate artist & teacher, lets get started! For more information: www.nory.co/class/sculpture1"
