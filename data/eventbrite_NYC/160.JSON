    "desc": "Our Winter Showcase is meant to introduce our newest students to the spotlight, while providing important stage time for returning students. Practice is a crucial component to developing any skill, and we at PAW believe in practicing the skill of performing. We will have completed just 11 weeks of instruction by December 6, so it is important to recognize this showcase as a teaching tool. There will be costumes, a stage, lights and sound, but this particular experience is primarily centered on learning the   of arriving at the final product. When we return to classes after this show, everyone knows exactly what we are working towards for our year-end showcase in June. Please join us in cheering on your children and giving them to the confidence to shine!"
