    "desc": "Workshops are geared toward kids ages 5 through 12. ? ? Design Tales and Design Kids are intended for families. We are unable to accommodate groups. Caretakers must stay with their child for the duration of the program. Each program day we present the same activity during two different time slots. When you select your event, reserve your tickets for the session time that works for you. Each adult needs an adult ticket, and each child needs a child ticket. Reservations are required to guarantee participation in Design Tales, and we do not keep a waitlist. Occasionally, however, reserved participants cannot attend the event, and there may be room in the program on the day of the scheduled event. If you were unable to reserve a spot, please arrive to the event location five minutes early and speak with our educators about joining. Please keep in mind that drop-ins are only accepted if space is permitting. Participants may be turned away if they arrive more than 10 minutes after the start of the program, even if they have a reservation."
