Wednesday, December 9th, 2015 ?for another installment of the Conversations on Urbanization series here at NYU. They will take China?s urbanization and the environmental dynamics of Chinese cities as starting points for the conversation.? Blue Skies over Beijing , ?Kahn?s forthcoming book with Siqi Zheng ? investigates the ways in which China's urban development impacts local and global environmental challenges. Using the historical evolution of American cities as a comparison, Khan and Zheng predict that as China's economy moves away from heavy manufacturing toward cleaner sectors, many of China's cities should experience environmental progress in upcoming decades. Please join us for what promises to be a lively and wide-ranging discussion. \n \n This event is co-hosted by? NYU China House ?and The NYU Wagner? Urban Planning Student Association ."
