    "desc": "On the Lower East Side, we'll visit veteran galleries and outside-the-box spaces as we see some of the city?s most cutting edge art. Smaller and more experimental than most Chelsea galleries, LES venues are often surprising and never dull. Tickets are $40pp. You can  register  to reserve a place and pay cash on the day, or buy tickets in advance for convenience.? New York Art Tours is the only Art Tour in the city to be awarded?
