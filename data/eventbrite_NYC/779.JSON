Back to when Berry Gordy's Motown label and his studio band the Funk Brothers and Stax record's Booker T and the MG's were the proponents of what came to be known as a historical style of music. \"Soul Music\" A trip back to when King and Smash records gave us \"The Godfather of Soul\" while the Columbia and Atlantic label brought us \"The Queen of Soul\". Now after a 28 year tenure with \"The Drifters\", vocalist Prentiss McNeil along with Bruce Wayne of the Wilson Pickett's \"Midnight Movers\" are leading this classic soul review with their unmatched energy and breath taking showmanship. A Decade of Soul is a passion driven classic soul tribute where it's difficult to stay in your seat!"
