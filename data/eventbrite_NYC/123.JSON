In  The Self-Help Myth:How Philanthropy Fails to Alleviate Poverty ?author  Erica Kohl-Arenas , Assistant Professor at the  Milano School of International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy  seeks to answer these questions in this eye-opening analysis.?She reveals how philanthropy maintains systems of inequality by focusing on the ?behavior? of poor people and ignoring the structural inequities that produce poverty. These strategies rely on American ideals of individualism and hard work, but when used in partnership with limits around what foundations will fund, these ideals become ill-defined concepts that leave poverty and inequality untouched. Kohl-Arenas bores deeply into how this plays out in California?s Central Valley, one of the wealthiest agricultural regions in the world and home to the poorest people in the United States. Author Erica Kohl-Arenas will be joined by discussants:? Michael Edwards , Distinguished Senior Fellow, Demos; and? Rachel Sherman , Associate Professor of Sociology, NSSR. Early Reviews: \"Beautifully written and carefully researched, this book is a must-read for anyone concerned with transforming?philanthropy into a genuine force for social change.\" ?Michael Edwards, Distinguished Senior Fellow, Demos \"A?stunning example of the failure of philanthrocapitalism and NGO humanitarianism to solve long-standing?problems of poverty in America...\"? ?Vincanne Adams, Professor of Medical Anthropology, University of California, San Francisco, and author of?Markets of Sorrow, Labors of Faith \"Kohl-Arenas combines nuanced ethnography and compelling historical analysis to show how the structural?interests of philanthropic foundations remain at odds with their stated goals to reduce poverty and inequality.\" ?Alyosha Goldstein, Associate Professor of American Studies, University of New Mexico, and author?of?Poverty in Common: The Politics of Community Action during the American Century"
