    "desc": "Join us for a unique short-term group in which Crochet is integrated into the Holistic Group Experience. As we engage in our own crochet projects, we discuss topics as they pertain to: \n \n ? ?  The areas in yourself that need ?healing? or to ?make whole? \n ? ?  Finding the passion in your life to stay engaged with others around you. \n \n As we share and develop connections with one another, we will find the common thread that unites us; the interest in developing inner resources to lead a more satisfying and whole life. \n Requirements:  Basic crochet skills, and a simple project to work on during the sessions. \n This is not a crochet class. Crochet materials or instruction are not provided. \n There are no refunds or cancellations"
