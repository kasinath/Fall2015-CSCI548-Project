This is the true story of 13 strangers ... but 3 died ...so now we?re 10 ... who were picked to live on a sketch team ... work together and have our lives ruined ... our director made us cut all ties with our loved ones so we could be in this weird comedy cult family ... seriously, help us ... to find out what happens when comedians stop being absurd and start being chairs. National Scandal is Pat Byrne, Gina Fitch, Melissa Surach, Jonathan Desley, Casey Cancellieri, Joanna Haussman, Jenifer Bloodsworth, Stephen McCarthy, Peter Zuorick, Gabe Capone and Sarah Nowak. Directed by motherf*cking Holden McNeely (Murderfist)"
