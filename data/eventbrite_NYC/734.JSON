    "desc": "Court Tree Collective ?presents cooking from the Republic of Georgia with chef Marina Berger. \n \n \n CLASS DESCRIPTION: \n Khachapuri is a cheese-filled bread found throughout the Republic of Georgia. Though it takes on many forms, Americans are probably most familiar with Ajaran khachapuri ? a boat-shaped yeasted bread, filled with cheese and topped with a runny egg and butter. In this class, I?ll teach you how to make the Ajaran classic, as well as Imeretian khachapuri, where the cheese is encased in a yogurt-enriched dough. Finally, we?ll make lobiani: not strictly considered a type of khachapuri, the cheese filling is replaced with red kidney beans (a Georgian staple) mashed with onions and coriander. We?ll conclude class by sitting down to eat what we?ve made, along with a classic Georgian salad, homemade tarragon soda, and a taste of Georgia?s unique amber wine. \n \n Sign up here! \n \n Marina Berger ?is a Manhattan-based personal chef. As the daughter of Soviet immigrants, she grew up eating dishes from all the former republics without knowing much about their origins. When she realized that some of her favorite ?Russian? dishes were actually from Georgia, she began to dig deep into this rich culinary tradition with her supper club,? Salt & Pomegranates ."
