That is In My Life: The John Lennon Tribute. Faithfully recreated by Carlo Cantamessa, who has portrayed the role of John Lennon in Beatlemania shows for 30 years. All live, with complete audience interaction and with the personal touch that makes each show an unique performance. In My Life: The John Lennon Tribute, the closest you can get to the legend."
