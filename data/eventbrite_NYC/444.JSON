    "desc": "(NY PREMIERE)?An aura of innocence and an immense sense of humor are qualities that director Cundieff (Fear of a Black Hat) brings to this story of a little boy?s eye-opening encounter with the facts of segregation in his Alabama hometown. Based on the novel by Michael Bandy and Eric Stein, the film charts a curious seven-year-old?s growing obsession with tasting the rare,?special water that he believes will flow from the ?Whites Only? public drinking fountain. Light-hearted but not lightweight, White Water creates a lovely panorama of small-town black life against the reality of the 1960s South. Directed by Rusty Cundieff, USA, 2015, ?95 min,?drama, English"
