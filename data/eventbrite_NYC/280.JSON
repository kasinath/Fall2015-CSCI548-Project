Many students from low-income communities are struggling. Essential programming is being cut, and students are entering high school unable to read at the appropriate grade level. As the world evolves toward a more technologically advanced future, Americans overall are losing competitive ground in S.T.E.M. (science, technology, engineering, mathematics). And while the dropout rate is steadily decreasing, its representation per ethnicity remains disproportionate?reaching as high as 46% in some communities. ? ? Cutting the dropout rate of a single graduating class in half would likely support as many as 54,000 new jobs and would likely increase the gross domestic product by as much as $9.6 billion. ? At the heart of TopSpin is a belief in the power of community and a little friendly competition. And while there are individual winners of the ping?pong competitions, we all win with our collective efforts in raising critical funds for some amazing nonprofits and their work in under-resourced communities."
