    "desc": "Panel discussion on non-partisan strategies to increase civic participation We know that voter turnout matters at the community-level, but aren?t always sure of the guidelines for voter engagement for 501c3s and schools. Speakers and panelists will share specific non-partisan resources and programs that community-based organizations and schools can use to increase voter engagement in 2016. Civic engagement, including voting, is an important part of strengthening any community. A commitment to working together to solve problems ? and to play a role in electing leaders to do so on our behalf- sets the stage for a community of opportunity. Voter turnout in the South Bronx is lower than NYC overall, and all individuals and institutions have a role in changing that next year. A recent Opportunity Nation study found a correlation between increased levels of civic engagement and positive social and economic outcomes for youth. While all residents should be actively engaged voters, helping to shape the political landscape around policies important to their community, it is especially essential to engage young people in the voting process. Voting is habit-forming; young people who engage in the voting process and actively vote are more like to carry this behavior through adulthood. The Panel will be followed by a South Bronx Rising Together End of Year celebration and reception. ?In politics, an organized minority is a political majority\"- Jesse Jackson"
