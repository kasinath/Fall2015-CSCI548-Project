    "desc": "Body products are tricky. Many contain chemicals that can be damaging to your skin and the environment. Learn to make your own natural lotion in this workshop led by Malinda Crump. You'll walk away with a jar of lotion, unscented or with a scent that deights you. \n Malinda began making body products in 2012, prompted in part by Artichoke Dance Company?s ecologically based performance series, The Human Mapping Project, in which she performs, and the research that the project revealed. She took on a mission to replace products laden with petrochemicals with natural formulas in an economical way. Her first experiment producing a simple lotion quickly developed into a full line of products to care for skin and hair. Her lotions, shaving gel, sugar scrub, deodorant and hair products can be purchased under the label bl? skincare, by special order and will be available for purchase at the event. Great for holiday gifts!"
