    "desc": "On March 13th 2016, 343 firefighters in full firefighting gear will ascend the 72 floors of 4 World Trade Center in the 2nd Annual New York City Firefighter Stair Climb. ?While each climber will climb in honor of one of the 343 FDNY firefighters killed on September 11th 2001, the climb?also memorializes fallen first responders and ?military?personnel worldwide. ? The New York City Firefighter Stair Climb is foremost a memorial climb, however each year we do designate a beneficiary and mount a fundraising campaign for that organization. The 2016 beneficiary will be Team Red White & Blue. ?The climb also taps into?firefighters?competitive?spirit. ?Climbers have the option to?enter as a racer and be timed against other climbers as an individual or part of a team."
