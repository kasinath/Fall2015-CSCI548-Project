    "desc": "Small groups are weekly meetings that occur throughout the semester that help students better investigate God, who He is and what He has done, by studying the Bible. This fall at John Jay we'll be having 8 weekly small groups throughout the semester. Students have the opportunity to join from one to up to four small groups if they would like; small groups last about one class period at different times, different days, and different locations.  Come and join?us as we learn more about the Bible, investigate who God is, and fellowship with one another!"
