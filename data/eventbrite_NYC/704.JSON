    "desc": "December seems to be a month that we crave cheese. Maybe because eating cheese is so much more satisfying when eaten communally, and December is a month of sharing food.? It's also a month of sharing drink, and what better way to enjoy cheese than with hand-crafted beers (or if you prefer wine, check out our Winter Wines and Cheese class).  \n So bundle up if you need to and come out for a Saturday afternoon with beer, cheese, and our friends, Stinky BKLYN!"
