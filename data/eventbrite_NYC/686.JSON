    "desc": "Cara Maria Piazza will teach you to transform seemingly disposable food scraps into liquid gold. In this class, you will learn how to use avocado peels, onionskins, pomegranate rinds and more to create color for dyeing. Bring up to three of your own garments to dye. \n Cara Marie Piazza is a natural dyer and artisan based in New York City. She creates beautiful one of a kind textiles using natural dye stuffs such as botanicals, plant matter, minerals, non-toxic metals and food wastes. She treats her fabrics through alchemical dye sessions, ancient shibori techniques and bundle dyeing, transforming each textile into its very own story."
