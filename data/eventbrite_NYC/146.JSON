At the She is Free Conference, September 29 - October 1, in New York City, women will be changed from the inside out, and empowered to administer freedom in their sphere of influence. Special Guest HAVILAH CUNNINGTON Teacher, Speaker, Author www.havilahcunnington.com www.moralrevolution.com? ? ?  In 2016 we are raising a banner for freedom. Jehova Nissi means ?The Lord my Banner,?? hoisted in times of great victory (Exodus 17:15-16). Because the Lord is our Banner, victory is always certain. As long as we are lifting Him up, it is under His presence and power that we are made strong and able to advance. Unity and strength come to a nation as women step into place without entitlement, bitterness, manipulation, insecurity, malice or pride. Health and wholeness come when a woman links arms with those around her. The cries of the poor, abused and disenfranchised are heard and their needs are met. When a banner is raised in times of war, it means the frontline is still intact and taking ground. When we raise our collective banner, we encourage others to fight for freedom in their personal lives and spheres of influence. It's time to raise the banner for freedom and stake our claim under God. We are free to set others free. Let?s fight from a position of victory. ? Can?t wait to see you there,"
