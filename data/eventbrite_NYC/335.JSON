    "desc": "A Victorian Christmas Card come to Life Visit London in San Francisco! The world-renowned  Great Dickens Christmas Fair  is the only event of its kind. The winding lanes of Victorian London come to life with over 3 acres of music halls, theatres, pubs, dance parties, and charming shops overflowing with hand-made holiday treasures. Enticing aromas of roasted chestnuts and hearty foods fill the air. It's a lamp-lit city brimming with over 700 lively and colorful characters from the imagination of Charles Dickens, the pages of history, and the sometimes saucy world of the Victorian stage. Open from 10 AM to 7 PM, five weekends and one Friday from Nov. 21-Dec. 20.  Free BART Shuttle from Glen Park Station every Fair day!  ?
