    "desc": "(NY Premiere) Across the country, there is a growing distrust between members of the community and those who are meant to protect it. In Los Angeles, a group of former gang members have joined forces with community leaders and law enforcement on a mission to break the cycle of violence that they were once a part of creating.  At its heart, License to Operate is a film about redemption, hope and change. It?s about rebuilding relationships and forging new alliances. It?s about healing the wounds of a community. It?s about how the effort of a few can change the direction of an entire city. Directed by James Lipetzky, 2015, USA, 101min, documentary in English."
