As such, the exhibition is as much about life as it is about art. \n These four European women, all left their native lands and successful careers behind to listen to their true aspirations and embark on a new journey in art. They returned to school and received a thorough art education, mastering various aspects of their respective disciplines. What separates them from other artists is that they create art based not on dictated or current norms, but rather inspired by their histories and cultural heritage. As such, their art is distinguished as much by its aesthetic quality as it is by the originality of the stories behind it. The result is a perfect opportunity for dialogue as well as appreciation. \n With:  Inma Barrero Laurence Belotti Fabienne Cuter Anne de Villem?jane \n Ten percent of the proceeds from the exhibit will benefit Entraide Fran?aise. \n No Frames has been made possible by the support of French Morning and the BWR Group."
