Without you, your talent, your creativity, or your voice Brooklyn Free Speech television wouldn?t be what it is today. Your presence is requested at our 10th Annual The Spirit of Giving Holiday Party on Friday, December 4, 2015, 6-9pm at our house? BRIC Arts | Media House! We?ll be serving good food, toasting the year to come, and playing really fun games for all ages. In keeping with The Spirit of Giving, we?ve partnered with Toys for Tots to bring joy to a child this holiday season. We?re asking all attendees to please bring one (1) unopened toy for our Toys for Tots box. All toy donations will go to the Toys for Tots Foundation. Happy Holidays and we?ll see you December 4."
