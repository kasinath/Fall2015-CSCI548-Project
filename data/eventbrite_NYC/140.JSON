    "desc": "The typeface families Quarto and Gotham Greek & Cyrillic were both released in the past year, but the thinking and processes behind the development of these two projects couldn't have been more different. Quarto was an act of interpretation, its forms inspired by a historical model from 16th century Flanders; Gotham's language expansion demanded even more of the technical and optical trickery that the family already secretly employs in order to adapt its seemingly simple forms to the Greek and Cyrillic scripts across its exhaustive range of weights and widths. A look at two of the many hats a typeface designer might find herself wearing on any given day."
