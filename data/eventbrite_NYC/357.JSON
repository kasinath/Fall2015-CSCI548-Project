Enclosed by the Suez Canal and bordering Gaza and Israel, Egypt's rugged Sinai Peninsula has been the cornerstone of the Egyptian-Israeli peace accords. Yet its internal politics and security have remained largely under media blackout, even as a rebellion shook the region in 2011. Now, with the crash of Russia's Metrojet Flight 9268 in October, the security and politics of Sinai are under international scrutiny. Why has Egypt's security approach in the peninsula been such a failure? What are the specific economic and social problems that have allowed arms trafficking, smuggling tunnels, and militancy to thrive in Sinai? What is the effect of the region's instability on Israel and Palestine, the greater Middle East, and beyond? Mohannad Sabry , an Egyptian journalist who has reported extensively from the Sinai Penisula, is the author of  Sinai: Egypt's Linchpin, Gaza's Lifeline, Israel's Nightmare .  He was named a finalist for the 2011 Livingston Award for International Reporting and has been published in  Foreign Policy ,  The Miami Herald , GlobalPost, Al-Monitor, and many other international publications. He was the field producer of PBS  Frontline 's \"Egypt in Crisis,\" which was nominated for the 2014 Emmy Award for News and Documentary."
