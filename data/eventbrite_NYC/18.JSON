    "desc": "In this emotional coming-of-age story, Niki and her sister Alice lose their mother in a car accident. Faced with separate foster care situations that will put them in different countries, the girls run away, pursued by a caring social worker named Cecilia. So as not to be found, Niki adopts the name Maya as the two siblings encounter a colorful cross-section of Roman citizens, including a handsome fire-eater named Marc and a dissolute tattoo artist who gives ?Maya? a Mohawk. Through this name change, Niki/Maya is hoping to shed her skin and circumstances, but the film delicately presents how this young woman can bring her two distinct identities into a harmonious whole. Director Tommaso Agnese, who has made several documentaries, draws a vibrant portrait of urban street life and adolescent angst, brought to life with memorable performances and characters. Matilda Lutz brings a memorable volatility to the lead role while Valeria Solarino (so memorable in  , NIC 2009) gives Cecilia an anxious solicitude that conveys her feelings over the two girls? situation."
