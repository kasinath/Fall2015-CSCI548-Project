How? Most of our frustrations come from confusion.? We know what the Scriptures say about God and His will and how He truly wants to bless and mature us, but sometimes we may need something more specific that will bring the pieces of the ?puzzle? together to reveal what the outcomes will be. ? ? ? Our ministry team has been anointed with gifts that enable them to discern present and future events that may ?join some of the dots? of your life together for clarity!? These gifts are what are commonly called ?prophecy? and the ?word of knowledge?.? ? Our well proven ministers and their words have been the source of encouragement and direction to thousands of people over 25 years of ministry."
