    "desc": "We are looking for enthusiastic participants to join Nodes and Networks, a collective experiment exploring biological systems as a model and metaphor for social intervention. Taking inspiration from slime mold navigation, bacterial communication, and insect cooperation, a group of artists, designers, and scientists are collaborating on a series of public experiments and interventions across New York City. School of Visual Arts, Fine Arts Building, 335 West 16 Street, New York, NY 10011 Contribute to the Collective Experiment in a day-long series of experiments and interventions taking place at TheSchool of Visual Arts BioArt lab, The Metropolitan Museum of Art and other sites across the city. Experiments will include navigating with live slime mold, computer modelling biological behaviours and human scale collective experiments in the city. Exact timings and locations of individual experiments to be confirmed, but a rough schedule for the day will look like this: 11-12: Nodes and Networks Introduction and opening talks 12-1: Lab experiments? 1-3: Site-specific experiments? (e.g. Central Park/MET/Citi Bikes) 3-4: Late lunch (independent, lunch not provided) 4-6: Introduction/recap. Lab/computer experiments 6-7: Share observations/ outcomes from whole day. Snacks and refreshments will be provided. It is free to take part in the Nodes and Networks Collective Experiment, but to get the most out of the collaborations we ask that participants are able to attend at least one full part or, ideally, the whole day. This event is tailored towards an adult audience, though mature and interested children are welcome to accompany adults (aged 12+). All attendees must register here. PLUS? To meet the team before the big day, to find out more and contribute your ideas, head down to the Peculier Pub on Wednesday 2 December, 7-9pm, for Meet the team leading the Nodes and Networks Collective Experiment in an evening dedicated to sharing ideas, stimulating conversations and sparking collaborations between artists and scientists on the topics of slime molds, superorganisms and optimized networks. A draft-beer drink discount will be available for those who participate. Please direct any questions to  info@sciartcenter.org .
