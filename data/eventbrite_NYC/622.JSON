    "desc": "Fire on Flaming Roads,  written and directed by Daniel Hainsworth,?is the darkly comedic account of four friends searching for answers, both real and philosophical, as a mysterious fire burns across the horizon. As the drugs take hold, and as strange events begin to occur, tensions rise as the friends realize that tomorrow may not come as soon as they?d hoped. This allegorical, apocalyptic one-act has been compared to  Waiting for Godot  for the Brett Easton Ellis generation and examines the apathy, detachment and disillusionment that may very well define twenty first century America.? \n Fire on Flaming Roads  will be co-produced by UTC and Carly J. Bauer and presented at the Arthur Seelen Theatre at the Drama Book Shop. \n \n ** this event is not wheelchair accessible and requires going down a flight of stairs, 18 steps. \n \n For more information, please visit :?http://untitledtheatreny.wix.com/home \n For any questions, please contact : carlyjbauer@gmail.com"
