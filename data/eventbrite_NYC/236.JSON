    "desc": "This is our last Digital Irish event of 2015! \n We are welcoming back entrepreneur Pat Phelan for a fireside chat to give us an update on his company Trustev and what they have been up to since he pitched at our event. \n Pat founded Trustev, a real time online identity verification platform, with partner Chris Kennedy in late 2012, as a solution to the fraudulent transactions he experience in many of his previous companies while trading online. Headquartered in Cork, Ireland, the Trustev platform is a unique approach to fraud detection which pattern matches thousands of datapoints in real time.  Trustev's technology can lower fraud to near-zero levels while simultaneously increasing revenues and reducing fraud policing costs. Trustev was publicly launched at TechCrunch Disrupt in NYC in May 2013, where they were one of 30 finalists picked from 2,500 entrants presenting on the Battlefield stage. Pat relocated to New York in 2014 to oversee the rapid expansion of the company in North America. \n We will also have 3 start up companies do a 3 minute fast pitch. Our focus for this event is to network so pitches and discussions will be shorter than usual. \n We hope you will be able to join us for a fun night!"
