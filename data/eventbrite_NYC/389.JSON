    "desc": "When word of our medal started to spread, people were so intrigued that it went viral.? Runner's World called our 2014 medal one of the coolest in the country.? Competitor Magazine called it the most useful.? Most important, you the runners loved it.? Runners from across the country started emailing asking if we had a remote program so they could participate from their home state (or country) and still earn our awesome medal.? So, by popular demand, we created the ODDyssey remote running program.? In 2015, we think that we have even surpassed that award winning and renowned medal.? So, we are inviting runners who cannot make it to Philly for our local race, to run remotely and earn their medal in their own hometown. ? Register for the remote program below.? Then you train for and plan a 13.1 mile route in your home town.? You can run your race at any time on or after June 14, 2015.??But, you must complete it by?December 31, 2015. Run your 13.1 and post it to social media, tagging us so we can see you at your finish!? We will mail you, ? * Obviously, we cannot provide any run support in your home town.? This is on your own. **?Remote registrants must live at least 50 miles away from Philadelphia and may not participate on the official course. You must do a traditional registration to participate in Philadelphia."
