There will be 12 amazing beers to taste and enjoy (unlimited), wine by the glass, german style food buffet and entertainment by acoustic guitarist Tony Caggiano. With the proceeds from this event we will be able to help the financially challenged families at the Morristown NICU with gift cards for gas & supplies for their newborns. Our goal is to make this already very traumatic situation a little bit easier on them. We will be accepting donations again for holiday sleepers (must be new, no zippers) with snaps. There will be a 50/50 for cash prize, amazing basket raffles and door prize too!!!! We can't help them without all of you, especially during this holiday season!  {Price per ticket is 55$} There are limited tickets available since there is 80 person max :)"
