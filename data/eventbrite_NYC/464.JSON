Crump is joined by a talented group of horror-philes from the major comedy theaters in New York. After playing clips from low-rent horror movies, the improvisers take the stage to finish the scene in new and hilarious ways. Shows also feature give-aways, sponsored raffles, and fresh horror trivia. Horror movie fan or not, you'll love this wild and fast show! Tech by Anthony Velez Gas Station Horror is J. W. Crump, Sean Reidy, Connor McClure, B. J. Thorne, Josh Krebs, Kaitlin Fontana, Sam Jackel, Michelle Francesca Thomas, Keisha Zollar, Tim Mele, and Ali Gordon."
