These systems capture and make use of the thermal energy created during electric generation, making them more energy efficient while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It is especially important for architects and engineers to have a keen understanding of this technology, how it can positively affect the resiliency of buildings & infrastructure they design and build, and know how to access available funding and technical resources. \n This ? day lecture will include a 90 min discussion of this technology, how it supports resilient buildings and infrastructure, and an essential 30 min tour of a working facility so participants may see the actual scale and needs of such technology.? \n Course Credit: AIA 2 LU/HSW PE NYS 2.0 PDH \n Note that there are two sessions of this course.?
