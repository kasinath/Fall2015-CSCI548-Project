    "desc": "*YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO BRING AN UNWRAPPED TOY* Join the  NYC Latino Professionals Meetup  (?NYCLP?) on Thursday, December 3rd at Katra from 6:00-10:00PM for an evening of networking, mingling and dancing for a good cause! Katra is a \"Moroccan-themed duplex lounge offering hookahs, pillow-filled banquettes & occasional belly dancing.\" Now in its 5th Year, the annual NYCLP toy drive benefits underprivileged children in NYC. The beneficiary of this year?s toy drive is the  The Violence Intervention Program  (?VIP?), a nationally recognized Latina organization that assists victims of domestic violence. The children of these domestic violence survivors will receive the collected toys. Since our young people are exposed to so much violence and negative images, we encourage you to donate toys that are positive and non-violent. Take advantage of this time to network with great Latino Professionals and be a participant to a great cause. If you have never attended one of our events, our networking happy hours are a great first event to attend. Our members are friendly so you will not encounter a cliquish vibe. Plus, our members are always eager to meet new people so don't be afraid to just say \"hi.\" DJ Tatetastic will provide the music for this event. NO COVER w/ RSVP. Food menu & drink specials. Feel free to invite your professional friends and colleagues. Subway:  Bowery (J,Z), Grand (B,D), 2nd Ave (F), Spring St (6)."
