    "desc": "Most of us dont realize that all the gum we chew is made with synthetic rubber. One of the reasons I started making chewing gum at home was to figure out a better way to carry on with one of my favorite habits without chewing on the same material they use for rubber tires! In this workshop you?ll learn how to make a batch of natural chicle gum for chewing, then how to separate it into batches for yourself or gifts for the holidays. We?ll talk about the benefits of chewing gum, a bit of the history behind America?s favorite brands, and why bubble gum is traditionally pink. Students will go home with a pack of homemade minty fresh gum and a handout with details about the process.  (Ages 15+)"
