Are you a 3D printing enthusiast who has exhausted all of the free tools out there and looking to level up your 3D modeling game? Then this 3D Modeling workshop series (2 Wednesday sessions) is just right for you. Rhino is a commercially well known and used 3D modeling environment for creating fabrication ready products such as jewelry, electronic enclosures, furniture, even vehicles. Because of its professional nature, Rhino has a steep learning curve. ?This 2 part series (on 12/9 and 12/16 from 10am-noon) will make it as easy as possible for beginners to understand how Rhino tools are designed for 3D modeling. Session One : How Rhino works. ?What a curve is. ?Curves to surfaces. ?How to create your first 3d model. Session Two : Surfaces to closed polygons. Transforming tools. ?Workflows. ?3D Print your object. For ages 21+"
