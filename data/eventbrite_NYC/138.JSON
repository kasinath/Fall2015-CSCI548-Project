    "desc": "Overwhelmed by strays, the Sicilian town of Scicli has placed a ban on unleashed dogs. A particular problem arises when mayor Antonio Blanco, who is bound to uphold the edict, discovers that his son Meno has attracted the affections of a friendly golden retriever who displays an aversion to leashes and fences and prefers to roam the streets unguided. Though the townspeople initially want the pooch penned, he begins to win them over when he starts performing remarkable protective acts, including saving a woman from being mugged and escorting Meno and his classmates to school. Taking a cue from its canine protagonist?s behavior,   also rambles around Scicli?s baroque alleys taking note of the various folks who populate them. From the trio of old men who provide a running commentary while sitting on a park bench to a vociferous talk-show host who threatens to unseat Antonio, director Alessia Scarso evinces the waggish charms of small-town life. The film, which is based on a true story and a real dog, is sure to be beloved by connoisseurs of canine cinema."
