    "desc": "TheAgile Youth Challenge is a programming hackathon/codeathon competition for students in grades 6-12, at any NYC or area school, with any level of programming experience.  There is no cost to participate in AYC; our organizers and supporters cover all costs except transportation to the events. We want to give as many kids as possible the opportunity to participate, and we want all participants to go home with awesome memories and some really cool prizes.  AYC was founded by members of several NYC schools, and grew out of the organizers? desire to blend ongoing learning experiences into the immediate and intense challenges of a hackathon/codeathon. The goal is to bring teams together in friendly competition, give them a chance to evaluate and learn from their performance back at school, and then present another chance to compete and apply what they?ve learned.  It?s a really cool experience. We hope you?ll come learn with us.  Find out more on the Agile Youth Challenge website. Schedule: 8:30am ? Register team  9:00 ? Welcome /?Keynote /?Agile intro  9:30??
