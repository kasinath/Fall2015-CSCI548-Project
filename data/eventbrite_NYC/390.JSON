We do this by hosting events such as this fall's TeenTech Global Youth Summit where various experts in the tech industry will lead workshops on technology and it's presence or purpose in a variety of fields. TeenTech NY is open to New York City students 9th grade and up! Unfortunately, there won?t be enough room to bring your parents. Who cares? Tech knows no weather! Also, Microsoft has fantastic conference space, so rain is definitely a non-issue. You are welcome to but don't have to. Food will be provided throughout the day (breakfast, lunch and a snack)?in buffet form by a Microsoft Aprooved Caterer."
