    "desc": "Communities and individuals who have been directly impacted by mass incarceration have the most knowledge when it comes to reforming the criminal justice system. Their experiences and stories can become the bedrock of public policy that can end the era of mass incarceration. The Northeast Regional Gathering is an opportunity for formerly incarcerated thought leaders to come together and speak to and create strategies with officials from the federal government. Together, we will form solutions to repair communities harmed by years of tough on crime public policy. We will address access to ladders of opportunity including employment, education, housing, and civic participation in the electoral process.? In addition, we will discuss policy recommendations that reflect what communities in the Northeast ?need from their federal government to ensure that all of its citizens can pursue the American Dream.? Daryl Atkinsons, BJA Justice Fellow will open and frame the day in the context of our history and author Kemba Smith will address the need for gender responsive strategies in criminal justice reform. ?Equally important, constituents will be able to hear from members of the ? Federal Interagency Reentry Council? about the unprecedented efforts the federal government has taken to ensure that all people have access to opportunity. Join us for a day of town hall discussions on this important civil rights issue. While many are impacted by mass incarceration and want to participate in the movement to create change, this particular gathering is specifically a space for formerly incarcerated community members. If you do not have direct experience with the criminal justice system we ask that you not take up this space. Please share this invite with individuals you are in community with who have  DIRECT  experiece with justice system. We are asking for all registrants to respond to the Just Change Survey ?http://bit.ly/JustChangeSurvey ?so that we may learn more about our attendees. There is also a section for individuals who are in need of travel support. Please respond to the survey ASAP.? Those closest to the problem are closest to the solution ."
