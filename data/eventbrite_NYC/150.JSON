    "desc": "The 25th N.I.C.E. - New Italian Cinema Events  presents: Giorgio Pasotti's and Matteo Bini's directorial debut film  \" Io, Arlecchino \" starring Giorgio Pasotti, Roberto Herlitzka, Lunetta Savino, Valeria Bilello in Italian with English subtitles Paolo Milesi has a successful talk show about to move into prime time when he finds out that his father, Giovanni, has cancer. Giovanni is a well-known  commedia dell?arte  performer from Bergamo whose troupe has fallen on hard financial times. Encouraging the group toward a final command performance, Paolo is forced to take the stage himself when his dad?s health takes a turn for the worse. Forced to rely on performative and physical talent over his telegenic good looks, the TV star gains a new respect for his father?s life and work.  Giorgio Pasotti , who co-wrote, co-directed and also plays Paolo, demonstrates a palpable affection for this very particular theatrical tradition that incorporates an overall improvisatory style underlain with broad humor and stock characters such as the mischievous servant Harlequin and the miserly merchant Pantalone. Representing a theatrical history that began in the 16th century, this heartwarming, rich film charmingly reinvents  commedia dell?arte  for the 21st. The event is free and open to the public on a first come, first served basis. Please arrive early, as admission is limited and not guaranteed by the present RSVP."
