    "desc": "Everything the Story Pirates perform is based on a story written by an elementary schooler - from the shame of chronic bedwetting to the tender love between the devil and some guy she met at Starbucks. With music, puppets, and a hilarious glimpse of the world through the minds of kids, this is the only show in town where you might see a David Bowie-style tribute to a good Hebrew School education. Based in New York and Los Angeles, the Story Pirates have blown the minds of 500,000 second graders. You're next. ? For ages 18+ Tickets include open bar."
