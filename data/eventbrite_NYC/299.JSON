Park. \n \n Social media compile data on users, retailers mine information on consumers, Internet giants create dossiers of who we know and what we do, and intelligence agencies collect all this plus billions of communications daily. Exploiting our boundless desire to access everything all the time, digital technology is breaking down whatever boundaries still exist between the state, the market, and the private realm. Bernard Harcourt offers a powerful critique of our new virtual transparence, revealing just how unfree we are becoming and how little we seem to care. His book \"Exposed\" guides us through our new digital landscape, one that makes it so easy for others to monitor, profile, and shape our every desire. We are building what he calls the expository society?a platform for unprecedented levels of exhibition, watching, and influence that is re-configuring our political relations and reshaping our notions of what it means to be an individual."
