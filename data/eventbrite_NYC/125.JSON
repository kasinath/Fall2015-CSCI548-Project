    "desc": "Everyone possesses an aristocratic bearing in their own right; each individual contributes an aesthetic to the world that otherwise would be missing. My art focuses on the allure of distinctiveness. \n The work presented in Street Royalty aims to express the casual nobility each of us possesses, featuring clothing from the style icons of the millennial generation: Kanye West, Raf Simmons, Jeremy Scott and Rei Kawakubo to name a few. \n Concepts such as the rejection of social affirmation, the validity of self, and the originality of thought emanate throughout this collection. \n No matter what cloth you are cut from, royalty is of the heart -- not heritage."
