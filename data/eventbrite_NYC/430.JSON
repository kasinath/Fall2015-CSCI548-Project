This Lightroom course will introduce you to the fundamentals of the Lightroom workflow. We will import photos into the library, develop and edit photos, and share photos using social media, web pages and printing. We will also look at ways to send photos to clients and how to keep your photo library safe from loss due to computer failure. Each student will be provided with a Mac work station with Lightroom 4. (Mac computer basic controls will be explained on the first day of class, as needed). Requirements: * Basic understanding of your digital camera's settings and options. * Efficiency to operate a Mac or Windows computer; students will be expected to be able to comfortably browse around a computer in order to follow up with the class. Note: Should the assigned instructor become suddenly unavailable, we'll allocate a substitute instructor. Find more dates at our  Photo courses page. ?
