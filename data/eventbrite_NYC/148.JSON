Lady Boss is an intiative for women in creative industries to kick more ass at work, and is also a platform to contribute to the larger dialogue around feminism in the 21st century. Lady Boss members are savvy, politically-minded, and are interested in reading between the lines, natch. We host monthly events and workshops, and have just kicked off season two this past September. As for Heritage Radio Network, do you know how punk rock they are? Not only do they operate out of a shipping container, it?s parked permanently in the backyard of the famous hipster pizza joint, Roberta?s.  And  they have a roster of shows hosted by the most kick-ass of women: Radio Cherry Bombe with Kerry Diamond, Tech Bites with Jennifer Leuzzi, Sharp & Hot with Emily Peterson, A Few Things with Of A Kind, and so many more I can't keep up."
