    "desc": "Learn how to taste, discuss and evaluate coffee as an industry professional. In this class we go over the steps of the cupping process?a standardized method of tasting that reveals all the subtleties of a coffee without any filtration (or milk and sugar for that matter). You?ll be amazed to discover how coffees from the same country?even the same region, or the same farm?can exhibit very different flavor characteristics when tasted side by side. Expect to leave with an understanding of: -The SCAA (Specialty Coffee Association of America) cupping protocol -The Coffee Taster?s Flavor Wheel This is also an excellent way to discover our latest and greatest coffees from Central & South America and Africa. Please contact  education@irvingfarm.com  with any questions. *If for any reason you're unable to attend a  scheduled  class please contact  Education@irvingfarm.com  at least 24 hours in advance. Due to limited space and  resources  we will be unable to refund no-shows or sudden  cancellations  and a $50 surcharge will be billed to wholesale customers."
