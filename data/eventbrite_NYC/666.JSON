    "desc": "Lazy Susan: ?(NY PREMIERE)?A friendly waitress Susan works a double at an everyday Cape Town restaurant, deftly serving gluttons and wasps, hipsters and high-tippers, racists and lechers. With some effort she maintains both wit and service in the face of obnoxious customers?until a lousy tip gets the better of her. Told from the perspective of a single lazy susan (rotating tray), this is dark comedy and social commentary at its best. Directed by Stephen Abbott, South Africa, 2015,?10min short comedy in English and Xhosa with English subtitles. \n Hear me Move: ?(NY PREMIERE)?Hear Me Move is South Africa?s first sbujwa dance movie.

Directed by Scottnes L.?Smith, 2015. South Africa. Drama. 103 min. English."
