Vision Board workshops are fun, messy, social, creative and insightful.? ? Imagine starting with a blank canvas and laying out, designing, choosing, creating EVERYTHING and ANYTHING you've ever dreamed?? We'll spend a few hours, cutting, gluing, painting, sharing dreams and goals and putting them together in one place. Bring your vision board home with you and put somewhere you can see it everyday. ? Our sub-conscious mind directs what we attract to us. By putting your Vision Board where you can see it, it can influence your sub-conscious mind toward your goals. ? THINGS will start to happen. Art supplies included.? **Please bring old magazines with you for your boards.**"
