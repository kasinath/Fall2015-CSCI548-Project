But when a demo tape of Arthur?s songs somehow made its way to Peter Gabriel and his Real World Records label, ?I came to find out that Peter thought the bass playing was weak on my stuff, but what he liked was the lyrics.?  Next thing Arthur knew, he was playing at Gabriel?s WOMAD festival (despite having played solo acoustic ?maybe one time before?), jamming with Gabriel and Joe Strummer in Real World studios in Bath, England, and was subsequently signed to Real World Records. ?It was crazy,?

His online-only ?Museum of Modern Arthur? serves as a repository for his creations."
