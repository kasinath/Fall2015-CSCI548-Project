    "desc": "Rio-born Brazilian composer / singer / pianist Luiz Simas is a genuine Carioca! A New Yorker since 1989, Luiz has led original groups in jazz festivals & clubs in the U.S., Europe & Brazil. Luiz? voice & music has warmed major venues including NYC Birdland Jazz Club, the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall & Rio?s Sala Cecilia Meirelles Concert Hall. In this unique rare Holiday Concert, besides Luiz playing his original infectious compositions & beloved Brazilian bossa standards, Luiz will talk about Christmas in the sweltering Rio Summer, & play a song specially composed for that theme. Luiz invites any singers who would like to share their experiences of the Holidays from different parts of the world to sit in & perform with him during this concert ? contact Luiz via his web site at www.luizsimas.com or through Project 142. ?Luiz Simas is not only a wonderful musician, singer & composer, he is an engaging performer who draws his audience into his witty, joyful sensuous musical world. Luiz epitomizes the fantasies we non-Brazilians have about that wonderful country, & with him, we all get to be Brazalian, at least for a couple of hours!? Judy Carminchael ? Pianist."
