Join us at our Peach Pit for the evening known as the Essex Restaurant NYC on Sunday, November 29 starting 8pm for Beverly Hills 90210 (Original) Trivia! For reservations visit; https://90210Trivia.Eventbrite.com The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members.? For example, if Dylan, Brandon, Brenda and Kelly are a team and Dylan gets put in charge, he will then reserve tickets for himself, Brandon, Brenda and Kelly = (4) in total.? PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. And remember, don't get too close you'll just get burned."
