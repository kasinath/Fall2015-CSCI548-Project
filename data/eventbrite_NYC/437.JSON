    "desc": "?Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.? Get your turkey eating pants ready... cause Trivia, AD is hosting Thanksgiving at Monica?s! We?re putting out the fancy wedding china for this year?s holiday at The Coliseum on Monday, November 23 starting 8pm.? We?ve got five rounds of trivia, three different kinds of potatoes, one half English trifle / half Shepherd?s pie, and desserts courtesy of Mockolate. Chandler?s waiting for you to try his ?chanberries? so make your reservations by visiting; https://FriendsQuizColiseum.Eventbrite.com ... otherwise this is all a moo point. The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members. For example, if Monica, Rachel, Ross and Chandler are a team and Monica gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Rachel, Ross and Chandler = (4) in total. PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. \"Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Good!\""
