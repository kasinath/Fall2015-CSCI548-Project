    "desc": "Join us for an evening with Peter Morville.? \n \n We think we're designing software, websites, and experiences. But we're not. We are agents of change. Our systems shape belief and behavior at scale. If we hope to be better, empathy for the user isn't enough. We must also wrangle with culture, governance, methods, metrics, and the false dichotomies of mind-body and plan-build, because the things we make are reflections of how we see and sort ourselves. In this spirited tour of information architecture, organizational strategy, and systems thinking, Peter Morville draws from his new book, I ntertwingled , ?to reveal how everything is connected, from code to culture. \n \n \n Peter Morville is a pioneer of the fields of information architecture and user experience. His best-selling books include  Information Architecture  (the \"polar bear book\"),  Ambient Findability ,  Search Patterns , and  Intertwingled . He advises such clients as AT&T, Cisco, Harvard, IBM, Macy's, the Library of Congress, and the National Cancer Institute. His work has been covered by Business Week, The Economist, NPR, and The Wall Street Journal. Peter lives in Ann Arbor, Michigan with his wife, two daughters, and a dog named Knowsy."
