Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic? Use your unagi to dominate all FIVE unique and challenging rounds. Don't blame the questions! Reservations can be made by visiting; https://FriendsTrivia.Eventbrite.com The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members. For example, if Monica, Chandler, Ross and Rachel are a team and Monica gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Chandler, Ross and Rachel = (4) in total. PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. piVOT!"
