    "desc": "Get ready for SERYF One Day Conference coming to you on November 28th at 8am! This year's theme is called \"Avengers of Faith\" on the topic of Apologetics based on 1 Peter 3 : 15-16 \"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander.\"? You might be asking yourself, \"What is an Apologetic?\" In simple terms, it is a person who defends their faith. Now you must be thinking why does my faith need to be defended? In today's society God is NOT present. He is around but do we even acknowledge him? We need to fight back and avenge our spirits, for it is lost and destroyed! We need to stand up and stand firm in the Word of God! We need to become the Avengers of Faith!? Pre-registration fee is $10. Preregistration closes on November 22, 2015 at 11:59 PM. Registration fee at the door is $12."
