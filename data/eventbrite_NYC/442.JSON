    "desc": "NOVA perfumer Julia Zangrilli hosts alongside Beauty Editor and Astrological Strategist Genevieve Leon. This workshop is Julia and Genevieve's translation of the essence of each sign into scent. In this intimate workshop we will highlight the qualities of each sign and it's corresponding scent profile, attendees will be able to choose several which Julia will use to build them a unique formula. Each attendee's formula will be recorded, and their fragrance blended on the spot. We ask that if possible, attendees come with screen grabs of their birth charts. These can be calculated at  http://www.elbertwade.com/atlas.html  with knowledge of birth time and place. With this knowledge, Genevieve will guide attendees in creating sun / ascendant / moon blends specific to their birth charts. Birth charts are not mandatory - attendees are equally encouraged to create their blend based on sign-qualities they would like to amplify in themselves. Throughout the workshop, there will be open group discussion with both Genevieve and Julia, at the end of the workshop there will be a 20 minute Q+A with Genevieve. Basic knowledge of astrology is encouraged but not mandatory. Most blends are not 100% natural, all are phthalate free. \n \n $200 10ml / $250 50ml -?3 hours"
