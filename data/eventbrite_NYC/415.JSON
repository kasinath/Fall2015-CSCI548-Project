    "desc": "The Upper West Side?s architectural masterpieces that contribute to New York City?s most fascinating layers are further textured by intriguing signage and hidden inscriptions. Even the most ordinary buildings have a variety of signs and lettering that reveal the most interesting details. Alexander Tochilovsky,* an educator and curator at The Cooper Union, will walk us through the neighborhood with a unique lens that focuses on an artistic layer of the Upper West Side and how this texture informs building history and architecture. You do not need to print out your ticket(s) for this event. Please check-in upon arrival, ideally 15 minutes before the walking tour is scheduled to begin."
