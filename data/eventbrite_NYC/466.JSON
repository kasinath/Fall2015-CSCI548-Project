    "desc": "The line between country music and soul is a lot thinner than one would think. Frazey Ford first gained attention as one third of The Be Good Tanyas?a group that was more Kentucky bluegrass than Memphis soul?but as a solo artist, Ford has proven that she?s got more than one trick up her sleeve. Ford?s most recent solo album  Indian Ocean  was recorded in Memphis with none other than Al Green?s amazing Hi Rhythm Section backing her up ? a dream come true for a Vancouver girl with a soulful spirit. While the soul thing may sound like a departure for Ford, it couldn?t sound more natural. Her voice still carries that familiar timbre, she?s just choosing to take it to different, groovier places. With elements of gospel and her old friend folk woven throughout,  Indian Ocean  is a natural extension of Ford?s first solo effort, 2010?s  Obadiah . Bold, sensual and confidently fragile, Ford is obviously not afraid to explore what lurks inside her, either musically or emotionally. She?s still singing the prettiest songs just like she did with her friends The Be Good Tanyas, just with an added dose of soul."
