    "desc": "The Power Hour is an immature college drinking game where a person attempts to drink a shot OF BEER every minute for an hour. ?? \"COMEDIAN'S Power Hour\" is a comedy show originating in Albuquerque, NM and now with offshoots in (NYC, Denver, Texas, Florida, etc.). It involves 2 chortle-mongers going head to head making this classic drinking game a comedy competition. Every show is different but a typical CPH looks like this:? -BOTH COMICS START BY CHEERSING THE AUDIENCE AND TAKING A DOUBLE SHOT OF BEER? -A comic does 2 minutes of stand-up? -BOTH COMICS TAKE A DOUBLE SHOT OF BEER -The other comic does 2 minutes of stand-up -ANOTHER DOUBLE SHOT OF BEER-? -Then typically a challenge (something like: 2 Minutes of Doing Each Other?s Stand-Up) -DOUBLE SHOTS -Another set of straight stand-up -SHOTS -Another Challenge (i.e. ? give your competitor a Best Man speech, worst speech takes an shot OF LIQUOR)? -SHOTS -stand-up? -SHOTS -challenge (i.e. - the comics are coaches and audience is a losing football team, give the best halftime speech) -SHOTS -stand-up You see how it goes....? Challenges change every show and usually end with something that'll really embarrass a drunk person (i.e. - \"Describe the plot to the saddest movie you've ever seen without crying\") Refereed by Sarah Kennedy and Brett Hiker"
