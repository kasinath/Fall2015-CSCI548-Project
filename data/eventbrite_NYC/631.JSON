Watts, John Benitez, Samuel Torres, Joel Frahm, Yosvany Terry among many others. ?He leaves no doubt that he is destined to play a role in the future of jazz.???

And this increases Valera?s importance as a musician in the arena of Afro-Cuban music.\" ? Raul da Gama,  Latin Jazz Network , June 2012 \"New Cuban Express is one of the best new Latin Jazz releases we?ve heard this year (or in a while, frankly), and sets a bar that will be hard for others to jump over.\" ? Bill Tilford, Timba.com, June 2012 \"With New Cuban Express, Valera stakes his claim for the establishment of a new sound in fusing rhythms of Latin with elements of modern/fusion.\" ?
