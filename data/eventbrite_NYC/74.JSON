    "desc": "This accredited course will provide basic design and installation instruction for engineers and architects for PV systems including National Electric Code, International Fire Code, and International Building Code considerations (or similar code systems). Participants will receive in-depth and hands-on training on the equipment commonly found in PV systems as well as on utilizing local electrical and building codes in the design and installation of PV systems. This course is intended to provide information fundamental to the design and installation of code compliant PV systems, but should not be considered a course that will provide all the information that one may require in this field. If applicable, please bring your PE #, AIA Member # and/or NY Training ID # with you to the event in order to sign in correctly for CEUs. Please bring a copy of the NEC Handbook for reference purposes. Additional reference materials and resources available through the PV Trainers Network website (see link):"
