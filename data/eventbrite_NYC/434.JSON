    "desc": "Everyone likes chewing gum, but pretty much nobody knows where it comes from, or if it really stays in our bellies for ten years if we swallow it by accident. Want to impress the kids at school with your knowledge of bubble gum and how we can make it at home? In this workshop you will watch me make a batch of all natural organic chewing gum from scratch, then we will each get a ball of it to form into whatever shapes we want. All students will go home with a small packet of homemade chewing gum, a handout with notes from the lesson, and a vow to never spit gum on the sidewalk again!   (Ages 7-14)"
