    "desc": "Fact. The Office Trivia at People Lounge is the most fun you can have on Tuesday, November 24 starting 8pm. Take a break from being The World's Best Boss, your classes at art school, or beet farming to prove you know the most about the Dunder Mifflin family. Prizes will be awarded in lieu of Dundees, and you don't want to be left empty handed. That's what she said! For reservations visit; http://www.TheOfficeQuiz.Eventbrite.com The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members. For example, if Pam, Jim, Michael and Todd Packer are a team and Todd gets put in charge, he will then reserve tickets for himself, Pam, Jim and Michael = (4) in total. PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. #DiversityTomorrow"
