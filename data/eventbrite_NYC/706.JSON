    "desc": "2800 North Americans volunteered to defend the Republic of Spain during the Spanish civil war, but few people know that many of the volunteers were African Americans. This documentary tells their story & their fight for democracy and for the civil rights that were denied to them in their own country. The documentary includes interviews with volunteers and archival footage and pictures from the era. This documentary thoroughly researches a little known episode of XX century history. Directed by Alfonso Domingo and Jordi Torrent, 2015,?Spain, 77min, documentary in English and Spanish with English subtitles. Q&A after."
