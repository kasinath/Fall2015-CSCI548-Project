    "desc": "We're celebrating Christmas and New Years Eve all at once at Friends Trivia \"Holiday Themed\" at The Coliseum on Monday, December 14 starting 8pm. Come hear the story of Hanukkah as told by Santa's most trusted advisor! Phoebe has written a new holiday song and Monica and Ross have promised to bust out their award-winning moves!? The entire trivia will consit holiday-related questions over the course of all 10 seasons. Study up!? Reservations can be made by visiting; https://FriendsQuizColiseum.Eventbrite.com The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members. For example, if Monica, Rachel, Ross and Chandler are a team and Monica gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Rachel, Ross and Chandler = (4) in total. PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. Hurry up and find a date, before you're stuck with Janice at midnight!"
