    "desc": "The natural partner for a hunk of cheese often comes from grains rather than grapes. Explore the truly American origins of bourbon, as well as the wide variety of aromas and tastes of the country's best ?lesser known whiskeys--from the spiciness of rye whiskies to the smooth, sweet elixir that is wheated whiskey. Whether they're light and honeyed, have a rich, sherried sweetness, or end emphatically with full- bodied smoke, American whiskey's characteristics create a fantastic foil for cheese!"
