Each home is paired with a professional designer who works with a team of Newcomer Volunteers to bring their vision to life. While the Tour is a fun, festive way to kick off the holiday season, it is also an important fundraising event that highlights the true spirit of the season. All proceeds raised by this event benefit local charities and organizations that are the essence of our community. Over the last ten years, the Club has donated more than half a million dollars to a wide variety of worthy organizations."
