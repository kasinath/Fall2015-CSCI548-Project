The show will feature Ty Hooker-Haring on bass, Alex Orthwein on keys and Colin Hooker-Haring on drums.? The video, directed by Sam Centore, references a simpler time in America when there were less distractions and more opportunities to enjoy the world in which they lived. In the video, Sam & Margot denounce modern civilization by retreating to the woods and become one with water in true Shakespearian fashion. We shot the video in the middle of the woods in Upstate New York, where we were nearly eaten by coyotes in the process. We are happy to be alive today to share the finished product! Much love, Sam & Margot"
