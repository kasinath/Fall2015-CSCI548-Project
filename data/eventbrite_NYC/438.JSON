The Thanksgiving Day Parade was first on the list.\" Could you identify the next song? Could you? Could you? You're invited to Tim Whatley's Night-Before-Thanksgiving party at Slattery's Midtown Pub on Monday, November 23 starting 7pm. FIVE challenging rounds of Seinfeld Trivia on Jon Voight's '89 LeBaron, including a few rounds on the episode, \"The Mom and Pop Store\" and other Thanksgiving-related hodgepodge.? Reserve your spot holding a rope under Woody Woodpecker at; http://SeinfeldThanksgiving.Eventbrite.com The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members. For example, if Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine are a team and Elaine gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Jerry, George and Kramer = (4) in total. PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF. We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event. \"Next Stop Pottersville!\""
