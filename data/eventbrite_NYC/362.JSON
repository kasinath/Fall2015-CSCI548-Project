The memoir, a project by award-winning author and journalist, Samuel G. Freedman with Kerry Donahue, raised over $28, 451 from a Kickstarter campaign, allowing the idea to come to life.  Join us at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism in midtown to celebrating the completion of this amazing project; there will be a reception followed by an opportunity to meet the book's authors and purchase a signed copy. This event is leading up to the book's hard release on World AIDS Day -- ?December 1st.? \n ?\" Dying Words: The AIDS Reporting of Jeff Schmalz and How It Transformed the New York Times,\" ?looks back at the life of Schmalz , a rising star as a young editor at the New York?
