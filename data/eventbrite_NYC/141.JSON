    "desc": "In  Pastrami on Rye,  the first full-length history of the New York Jewish deli, Ted Merwin traces the rise and fall of the Jewish deli in New York from its inception on the Lower East Side, to its heyday during the interwar era, to its rapid decline in the decades following the Second World War.? Merwin also explores the recent surge in popularity the deli has had among contemporary Jews who are returning the deli to cult status as they seek to reclaim their cultural identity. ?The author will give a short talk about the book and sign copies, which will be available for sale."
