Now it is time for the discussion group to reconvene, and for emergency preparedness professionals at New York City Emergency Management to consider and evaluate the role of speculative thinking and what has been produced and proposed.? \n Participants: Iskra Gencheva, NYC Emergency Management Ben Krakauer, NYC Emergency Management Elliott P. Montgomery Chris Woebken? contributing artists and designers? \n Held in conjunction with the apexart exhibition? Alternative Unknowns,? an exhibition of potential emergency organized by Elliott P.
