Especially in the product world, the winning philosophies always center upon the keystones of responsiveness, usability, and simplicity. Sometimes, however, it can be hard to convince key decision makers of the immense value that accompanies brilliant design when there are often few quantifiable measures. ?At our next UX Summit in December our discussion will centre around the? Art of Storytelling in Design ?- how content and storytelling shapes the process of effective design and product management. In San Francisco we had amazing, top speakers from  Hewlett-Packard ,  Skully ,  Cisco ,  Citi Ventures , and  Kastner & Partners .

Feedback from our previous Summits: \"These summits are some of the most inspiring gatherings that I've attended in years.\" ? Attendee \"I was blown away at the quality of both the content and production at the UX summit. I try to attend about 12-15 conferences a year and I rank yours as one of the best. It was a great venue, perfect size, excellent topic, and outstanding speakers.\" ? Mark Hanson, Sr. Strategist, Nuance Communications \"It was, hands down, the best summit, seminar, conference...doesn't matter what it's called, I've attended in years. Clearly your network includes some amazing folks, and not just the speakers. I really enjoyed talking with the other attendees as well. Again, thank you for allowing me to have a little glimpse into your world...it was absolutely time well spent.\" ? John Ledingham, UX Director at Plantronics \"Got me out of my day-to-day execution to see a big picture that opens a lot of exciting possibilities. Each person has real rigor behind what they do; it wasn't just fluff and rah-rah. Met some really interesting people outside my usual circle.\" ??Bob Ertl, Sr. Director, Product Management at Sentilla Venue: HYDE Sunset"
