Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like?and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.? ? ~~~   During the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. ?Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening.
