    "desc": "USC?s VAST Outreach office is offering a coding event, Code Dojo, which supports K-12 teachers and families learning to code. This event is completely free and does not require any previous experience or knowledge. The Community Computing Center is close to the University Campus and easy to find. This is a great way to learn more about the word of coding! The session will be led by Dominic Caguioa, a representative from code.org which is a nonprofit dedicated to expanding the access of computer science. For more information about our event, please visit our website:  http://www.viterbi.usc.edu/k-12/coding/code-dojo.htm This event is held because of the Computer Science Education Week & the global Hour of Code movement."
