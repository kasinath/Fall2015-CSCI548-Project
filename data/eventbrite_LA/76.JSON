    "desc": "A special  Mortified  event held at the historic  Pico Union Project , a?beautifully renovated, century-old venue?in the heart of downtown LA that has been a synagogue, a church, and theater.? Now in its 14th year, Mortified? showcases adults sharing aloud their most embarrassing childhood writings-- old diaries, love letters, poems, home movies-- in front of total strangers.  In celebration of Hannukah, this special edition of Mortified is themed around the many \"miracles\" of adolescence, featuring participants of multiple faiths, and is open to ALL .  Special guests, live music, contests TBA. Presented by Mortified in partnership with  Nu Roots  and the  Jewish Federation of LA .  Doors at 7pm. Show at 8pm.   Food & drink: there will be beer/wine sold and a food truck outside. Good news for those : all attendees will be seated;?there is no \"standing room\" in this venue. New to Mortified? Visit  getmortified.com  or watch the  trailer  to our concert film to learn more. Advisory: This event will feature R-rated language and topics best suited for adults."
