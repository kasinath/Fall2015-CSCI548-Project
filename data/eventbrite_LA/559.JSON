    "desc": "The Geodomain industry is constantly evolving, and few things are certain anymore. ? The founders of Geo.CEO felt the need to do something about it, and combine decades of experience building, maintaining and exiting from locally targeted information services. They wanted to create a space where industry people with unique needs could come together to network and connect. There is no other conference like it. ? Geo.CEO is open to all Geodomain websites & apps, and its program will be focused towards decision makers of the respective companies."
