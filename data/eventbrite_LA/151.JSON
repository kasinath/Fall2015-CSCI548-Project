We are very excited to be bringing you this event as we are going to gather experts from all over the world to discuss the topic of how to find a job you truly care about. And much more! We live in a time where so many people are unhappy with their work and believe this is a great opportunity for individuals to truly  find your passion . All too often people become unclear with what it is they are doing and we feel this makes people very sad and depressed. Unfortunately people were not taught at a young age how to  discover your life purpose  so we walk around not sure who we are or what to do with your life. This is why we created a  career test ?so that you can take the time to find the clarity you need to create a path towards what you want to do with your life. We have many speaking coming from websites such as  Monster.com  and  Indeed.com  who will be speaking and offering advice to those individuals who are serious about finding their dream job. This program will be limited to only 500 people and is on a first come first serve basis."
