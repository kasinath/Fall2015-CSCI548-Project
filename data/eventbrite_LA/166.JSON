Celebrate the holiday season with food and drink specials all night, an ugly sweater contest, and great friends! Space is limited and the price goes up at the door, so get your tickets early! Your $15 ticket includes admission, light appetizers, and food and drink specials! Don't forget to bring a new, unwrapped toy for the toy drive! (Special Needs Network is requesting?toys, electronics, toiletries or clothing for children and teens from 1 to 18 years old. Mattel Children's Hospital is requesting infant/toddler toys, preschool/school age toys, board games, arts and crafts, and toys for adolescents.) This event is open to all Bruins, Trojans, and friends (ages 21+). Special Needs Network provides advocacy and support services for families with children who have autism and developmental disabilities in South Los Angeles, which is a region of LA County that has next to no services to speak of for these families. Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA cares for the physical and emotional well-being of children of all ages, from newborns to young adults."
