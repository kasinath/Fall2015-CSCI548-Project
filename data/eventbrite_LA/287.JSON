Topics will range from music to art to friendship and even daily challenges. This conversation is to help build a support system amongst the Miss May I community, so don't hold back. Grab your ticket and let's talk! ? We ask that you meet behind the venue at the white Miss May I trailer 15 minutes prior. From there Levi and/or our TEI representative will escort you into the venue for the workshop. We hope you have great experience!"
