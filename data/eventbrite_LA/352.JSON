    "desc": "Must be a current & eligible TCD member. If you haven't been to class before, you MUST call the office before attending. Sides are posted on the calendar. Must bring with as we do not print sides. Help us save trees!? Camera Shy? You don?t have to be. The secret of coming across realistically and naturally in front of a camera is to be rather than to act. Sound easy? Well, it?s not. It may seem like a paradox, but it takes a tremendous amount of on camera training to look like you?re not acting at all. We create an on set environment, to get you ready for your webseries. Each actor will get a digital copy of their work! Check out our production reel!? & Meet the? TCD team!"
