Must bring with as we do not print sides. Help us save trees! Auditioning can be scary and extremely stressful because actors don?t get many opportunities to practice in front of the camera. Watching your performance is crucial to the development of your craft. Prepare the scene just like you would for a real audition, this includes bringing a printed copy with you. All videos are uploaded to actors' TCD box folder. Check out our production reel!? & Meet the? TCD team!"
