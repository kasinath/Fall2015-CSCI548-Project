    "desc": "L.A.?s brightest holiday tradition shines more brilliantly than ever! Stroll through an expanded area of the Zoo that is transformed into a fantastical wonderland populated by glowing light animals and a trove of dazzling additions over last year, such as a decked-out L.A.I.R. and a dramatic display combining light, water and music. View real reindeer, visit with Santa ( on select dates ), and enjoy holiday treats and goodies, all under the stars.? This is a rain-or-shine event. No rain checks will be issued. Since L.A. Zoo Lights is a special evening event, the only animals on display will be  the reindeer at Reindeer Romp Village? and the critters within the L.A.I.R. The rest of the Zoo?s animals will be off exhibit and snug in their beds. (Note: Electric animals will be present.) For groups of 50 or more,?please contact group sales at:  group-sales@lazoo.org Looking for a different date? View our  calendar of dates . To learn more, please view the? L.A. Zoo Lights website .
