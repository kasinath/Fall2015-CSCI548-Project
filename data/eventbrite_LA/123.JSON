Thursday, December 3rd  3:00 -5:00pm Refreshments will be served Attending disciplinary conferences to present your research is integral to academic success, however the larger goal of these meetings is to build professional relationships with scholars as future colleagues. The expectations and familiarity with networking can act as a barrier and often graduate students and postdocs feel underqualified and unprepared for these conversations.? During this 90 minute workshop graduate students and postdocs will learn tips and tricks from UCLA faculty on how to network appropriately in academia, identifying and demystifying some of the pitfalls and unspoken rules of the industry.? Faculty participants will then be available at the end of the session to ?network? with graduate students and postdocs to put some of the strategies learned into practice.  ?This event is open to UCLA Graduate Students and UCLA Postdoctoral Scholars"
