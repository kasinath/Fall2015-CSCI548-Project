Must bring with as we do not print sides. Help us save trees!? Need to brush up on your cold reading skills? A diligent actor practices out loud and in front of others so they?re more relaxed and polished. Holding onto sides is a crutch and takes away from important aspects of your performance, including body language. Actors will have a much better understanding of why being off book without the paper is important. It allows you to quit worrying about your lines and focus on just being yourself in a scene. By the end of class, you?ll be off book and more confident:). You?ll get an awesome workout! Must be on time and present for the entire class. Check out our production reel!? & Meet the? TCD team!"
