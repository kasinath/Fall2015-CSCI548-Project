Learn all the fundamentals including, basic scale and chord theory, open chords, understanding and creating chord progressions, how to play familiar songs and how to create songs of your own.     Our instructor?s specialty is demystifying and simplifying music to make it easy for anyone regardless of previous experience or your ability (or lack there of) to read music. Students must provide their own guitars (acoustic or electric).    Student's are encouraged to arrive early to the first class session so that the instructor may tune your guitar prior to class time. If your guitar is more than 10 years old, or if it appears to need maintenance, early arrival will allow you to discuss your tune up or maintenance options before class time. Instructor:  Mark Flores Course Meeting Schedule: Thurs., Jan. 28, Feb. 4, 11, 18, 25 & Mar. 3 Course Meeting Times: 7 - 8:30 p.m.? NOTE: Students must provide guitar (Students may arrive 15-minutes early to have guitar tuned.)"
