    "desc": "West Coast Premiere Hit the Wall Written by Ike Holter Directed by Ken Sawyer Produced by Jon Imparato/Los Angeles LGBT Center and Adam Silver/Sixth Avenue Please note: Thursday, October 22 is an understudy night Starring: Jason Caceres ? Burt Grinstead ? Charlotte Guzelian ? Matthew Hancock ? Kristina Johnson ? Roland Ruiz ? Shoniqua Shandai ? Adam Silver ? Donnie Smith ? Blake Young-Fountain Original music by Anna Waronker (That Dog) and Charlotte Caffey (The Go-Gos) It's the summer of '69. In a dangerous cocktail of oppression and heat at New York City's underground gay nightspot The Stonewall Inn, a routine police raid erupts into a full-scale riot, igniting the LGBT rights movement. Smash that event against the vivid theatrical imagination of playwright Ike Holter, add live original music by Anna Waronker (That Dog) and Charlotte Caffey (The Go-Go's), and you get an immersive theatrical remix that thrusts you to the center of Stonewall. There will be no late seating for this production.?Hit the Wall is an immersive theatre experience, It would be best to leave any bags, backpacks, etc. in your car. Please let the house manager know upon arrival if you have any mobility issues."
