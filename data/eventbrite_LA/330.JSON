The seminars are in a series of 10. Parents gain knowledge by investing the time to attend all ten. We understand that this maybe difficult for working parents so will repeat the ten seminars again at the weekend or in the evenings, dates will be finalized shortly. For more details on the full program please contact the organization. Parents and guardians who attend all ten seminars will receive a certificate of completion. A graduation for those in attendance will be given after the final seminar. This training can be paid for by funding that schools receive, Title 1 dollars, LCCF funding, PTA/PTO funds and charitable donations."
