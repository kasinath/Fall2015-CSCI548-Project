    "desc": "Patch clamp electrophysiology has matured from a highly specialized scientific technique to a recognized method used to address a variety of experimental questions.?? Sutter Instrument introduces a highly flexible, intuitive patch clamp instrumentation and software package that enables the experimenter to quickly set up and perform routine tasks, yet remains highly configurable to meet the demands of the experienced electrophysiologist.  We will demonstrate how the  IPA? Integrated Patch Amplifier and SutterPatch? software  can be used for a variety of commonly performed assays, including the characterization of an ionic current and the recording of synaptic events in tissue slices. We will also highlight how the IPA and SutterPatch software provide easy access and flexibility to perform and fine-tune the most challenging acquisition and analysis scenarios. ? Building on the basic pipette pulling tutorials presented at the 2015 user meeting and a  mid-year webinar , we will further teach advanced techniques that enable the user to create specialized pipette morphologies for unique applications. ? There will be plenty of opportunity for discussion with hosts and presenters from the Sutter Instrument Tech Support Team. Registrations are accepted on a first-come-first-served basis. ? Who should attend ? ? Hosts and Presenters:"
