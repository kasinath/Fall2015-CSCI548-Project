    "desc": "No other type of photography draws as much admiration and appreciation as does Life Photography (A.K.A. photographing the human body), or more specifically, nudes. The curve of a woman's hip or the nape of a breast, the strength of a man's strong legs and the curves of his musculature, this is what this course will help you capture and honor.  Unlike our eyes, a camera can capture and freeze the human body in a way that can be appreciated for an eternity. Everyone can find beauty when looking at the human form, but when captured as the subject of art, the beautiful body has no bounds. This fun, eye-opening and artistic course will teach you different and creative ways of capturing the beauty of the human body through the lens of your digital camera. Lessons will include; how to capture the human body?s most minute details, like pores and hair follicles, to our most intimate of perspectives through the full-body, erotic nude. Students will learn how to capture the human form in a controlled studio setting as well as out in the light of day and dark of night. Instructor:  Dali Sadhanna Course Meeting Schedule: Tues., Mar. 1, 8, 15 & 22 Course Meeting Time:?7 - 9:30 p.m."
