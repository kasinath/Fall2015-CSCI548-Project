    "desc": "The origin of the? Nutcracker , a classic Christmas Story, is a fairy tale ballet in two acts centered on a family?s Christmas Eve celebration. Alexandre Dumas P?re?s adaptation of the story by E.T.A. Hoffmann was set to music by Tchaikovsky and originally choreographed by Marius Petipa. It was commissioned by the director of Moscow?s Imperial Theatres, Ivan Vsevolozhsky, in 1891, and premiered a week before Christmas 1892. Since premiering in western countries in the 1940s, this ballet has become perhaps the most popular to be performed around Christmas time.  AdultBalletLA ?is taking a fresh look at the Nutcracker! LA Nuts blends Hollywood's classic dance movies with Hollywood's classic Christmas movies. Driven by the exciting jazz music of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn's \"Nutcracker Suite,\" and, of course, AdultBalletLA dancers, the Nutcracker will never be the same!
