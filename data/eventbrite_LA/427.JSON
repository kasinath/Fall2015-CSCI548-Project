    "desc": "It?s headshot day again! The photo should look like you in a natural pose straight to camera, clearly displaying your entire face. The headshot will usually take in the top of your shoulders but shouldn?t include the rest of your body. If you want some body shots, we?ll certainly take some for ya! Make sure you get a good night?s sleep before the session and arrive wearing clothes that make you feel comfortable, confident and relaxed. Ensure the clothes don?t distract from your face (no loud shirts or patterned blouses) and help bring the focus your face. Don?t wear too much makeup and don?t get your hair cut the day before ? give a new cut time to settle in. Also avoid props, backgrounds and accessories or anything that distracts from your face. Must call or e-mail the office to check eligibilty requirements"
