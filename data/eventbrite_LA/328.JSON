His classes harmoniously balance relaxation, technique and scene work, which give an actor so much to explore and relish. Whether a working actor wanting to study, beginners, or even people wanting to re kindle the old artistic flame, Luke's teaching's are accessible, practical and engaging to all levels. I have been challenged and liberated in my time studying under Luke and have had many tools illuminated in my repertoire as an actor. His fascination with the human condition and open minded passion for acting is a rarity.\" We look forward to seeing you at the studio!"
