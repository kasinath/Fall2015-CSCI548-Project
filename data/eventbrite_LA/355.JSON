A piece by Mauro Sacchi Direction, staging and choreography by Mauro Sacchi Create and performed by Mauro Sacchi with Bonnie Yu He Lin (???) Music by Tyzen Hsiao (???) Small Things with My Father is a live performance that combine dance and theater for physical story-telling, specifically adapted for a gallery space, set to a rearranged score written by Maestro Tyzen Hsiao.? It deals with presence and absence, in space and in spirit, and with the meaning and narrative possibilities of movement.? It represents physical memories and relationships and (re)creates new ones, in the moment, borne out of both personal histories and the immediacy of the performance space and the live audience. It is a celebration of life, a commemoration, and a prayer. RoHsuan?s Photography Work ????, inspired my Maestro Tyzen Hsiao?s music Temple of days, Sun inside my door.
