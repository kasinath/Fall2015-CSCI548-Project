The toast of Toronto today may end up burning you down the road if your residuals outlays end up being higher than expected for the markets you plan to sell or license to.? Likewise if you're on the other side of the table, as a producer. Your latest project may have distrib suitors blowing up your phone, but how do you know its true value without knowing the residuals liabilities that come with it?? This webinar is for distributors, sales agents and producers who want a better understanding of the ways complex guild residuals formulas can make a deal a winner or loser. We'll give you a look at the big picture as seen by an expert residuals analyst with an eye on all the variables.? You'll also get a quick tour of our online tool, the Residuals Forecaster... which our clients use to compare various scenarios against one another: changing triggers, runs and other variables to see how they affect the bottom line of a property.?
