For many of our children this is the only holiday celebration they'll have all year. Children's Institute, Inc. with help from our partners will host a holiday celebration for more than 1,000 of Los Angeles' most vulnerable children - many are victims or witnesses to violence in their homes and communities. Event activities include toy selection, arts and crafts, cookie decorating, story time, music and more. Please join us on Saturday, December 5th at CII's Otis Booth Campus to be a part of the holiday cheer. Volunteer responsibilities range from helping with set up, helping children select a toy, a book and or handing out food and water, to helping with breakdown of the event. Volunteer t-shirt, food, drinks, and parking provided. PLEASE NOTE: *****"
