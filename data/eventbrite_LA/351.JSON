    "desc": "Silks Practica is a weekly event for people of all skill levels to come together and learn how to stretch, develop silks skills and conditioning to help you get stronger. The goal is to provide a community of silks artists helping each other gain new silks while refining and learning new ones. The benefit of coming to our weekly event is that class size is smaller then regular classes at a gym with a low price point at $5 for first time $10 for Regulars. We are located downtown so it is a central place for comnuting. We also hope to provide Guest teaches as well as workshops for our group of silk artists. Private lessons please call The Build Shop for more information:? (213) 291-3299 ?
