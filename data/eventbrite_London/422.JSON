    "desc": "November 25th will see our first NUJ Young Workers event. It's an event aiming to launch a network of greater participation of young people working within the new media industry and communication startups. Through the NUJ we're aiming to increase the possibilities and awareness of your rights in the workplace and possibilities of career development within new media and journalism. For those just starting to venture out into the industry, hopefully we can discuss some of the difficulties and strategies for getting ahead in what is an increasingly competitive market.? We are also hoping this event can form the basis of a new network of young trade unionists in the NUJ who can help organise future events and participate in youth-focused activism in the union. Anyone with a serious interest in getting involved with the union more directly should come along and we can hopefully begin building a new movement within the NUJ. , a documentary filmmaker who has produced work for Vice and others will be talking about his work and the future of New Media. , a journalist who has produced content for Sky and the BBC - and founder of?  will also be speaking about the importance of communication startups. This event is about networking, learning about the union, having a few drinks and thinking about what we can do in the future.
