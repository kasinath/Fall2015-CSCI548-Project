Where do they come from? What would life be like without them? And what would happen if we opened them, heated them up, cooled them down, pointed them in a different direction, or, even, pressed this button? This is the only opportunity anywhere in the UK to hear Randall talk about 'THING EXPLAINER: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words', via a live stream from the Space Centre Houston. With each booking you can submit a question for Randall, who will answer a selection during the live stream. Tickets include a limited edition signed hardback copy of THING EXPLAINER (rrp ?16.99) Randall?s last talk here was an almost instant sellout, so act fast to avoid disappointment as places are limited! Discounted tickets are available to Members of the Ri."
