    "desc": "AT THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE Michael Banton, Professor Emeritus, University of Bristol Wednesday 3 February at 5.30pm The expression `race relations? was adopted by the London School of Economics in 1947. It was the title of a course, and a lectureship, in the Anthropology Department. At that time Michael Banton thought that there must be a mistake somewhere in this usage. Over the ensuing years he has tried to identify the nature of this and related mistakes. He pinpoints a failure to differentiate ordinary language and technical language. This is paralleled by the distinctions between emic (or folk) and etic (or scientific) constructs. His new book,  , starts from a paradox in the 2002 statement of the American Sociological Society.? While denying the scientific validity of classification by `race?, it pleads for the collection of data based on the US Census question `What is your race?? The statement?s appeal to the argument that `race is a social construct? does not resolve the paradox. Prof Banton's book,  , is available from Berghahn Books  ."
