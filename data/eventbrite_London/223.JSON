    "desc": "Rupert Sheldrake, Ph.D. is a biologist and author of more than 80 scientific papers and 10 books. His most recent book, The Science Delusion, received the Book of the Year Award from the British Scientific and Medical Network. He was a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge, and Director of the Perrott-Warrick Project, funded from Trinity College, Cambridge. Rupert Sheldrake is best known for his hypothesis of morphic fields and morphic resonance, which leads to a vision of a living, developing universe with its own inherent memory. In this special talk at the Psychosynthesis Trust, on  , Rupert will show how the ?scientific worldview? is moribund, arguing that the sciences are being constricted by assumptions that have hardened into dogmas. Rupert will discuss how the sciences themselves are now transcending the materialist philosophy, and pointing toward a new sense of a living world. The paradigm shift in the sciences helps shed a new light on spiritual practices like pilgrimage, ritual, prayer and meditation, supporting modern day spirituality.
