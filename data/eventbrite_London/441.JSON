LECTURE SERIES 2015-16         The Social Contribution Injustice of Punishment by Associate Professor Kimberley Brownlee, University of Warwick Chaired by Professor John Gardner, University of Oxford ? on Thursday 28th January 2016, from 6-7pm Venue:   UCL Gustave Tuck Lecture Theatre Accredited with  1 CPD hour  by the  Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Bar Standards Board ? About this lecture: ? People are social beings. We wrong a person as a social being when we deny her adequate access to decent human contact. We also wrong her as a social being when we deny her the chance to contribute socially. This lecture explores this second type of wrong, which we can call social contribution injustice. The obvious victims of social contribution injustice are the people we deem to be socially useless or threatening. Offenders are a paradigm example. This lecture applies an analysis of social contribution injustice to our standard practices of punishment to expose the many ways that we wrong offenders as social beings."
