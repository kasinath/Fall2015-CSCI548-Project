    "desc": "Considering David Bomberg?s unorthodox approach to image-making, as well as the role of photography in artistic process, Chorpening will place the historic drawings in   in a wider context, with reference to contemporary drawing practice. Chorpening will discuss charcoal works by artists including Dennis Creffield (whose monumental cathedral drawings fill one wall of the exhibition), in relation to works by William Kentridge, Robert Longo and Kara Walker. These three artists explore issues of race, gender and socio-political identity, often in powerful large scale drawings. For example, Longo?s 10ft drawing of a viral photograph of the 2014 Ferguson riots. Taking how Bomberg and his students use charcoal to express physicality rather than likeness as a starting point, Chorpening will consider how this approach has continued and adapted. This talk will lead us to question the place of emotion in art-making today."
