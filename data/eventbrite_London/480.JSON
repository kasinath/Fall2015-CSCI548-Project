    "desc": "The conference will focus on programmes tailored to the needs of the world?s ultra poor, analyse new research findings from the field and share best practices. By unpacking the mechanisms of these initiatives, we aim to increase their potential impact, scale and spread, with the ultimate aim of supporting countries to end extreme poverty by 2030 under the first Sustainable Development Goal. The event will evaluate aspects of this approach, assess the role of training, compare assets versus cash transfers, examine the risks and opportunities of scaling up, and debate the need to advance the social protection agenda."
