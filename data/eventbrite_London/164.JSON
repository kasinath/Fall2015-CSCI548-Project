You will hear the experiences and motivations of a Parliamentarian with a disability, the ways in which Parliament itself actively supports members and staff with disabilities, and the personal insight of disability campaigners who engage regularly with Parliament.? We aim to make the event as accessible as possible.? A BSL interpreter and a palantypist will be provided. Please email  universities@parliament.uk ?  to discuss any specific access requirements. This event is part of the Perspectives on Parliament series of events (formerly known as Open Lectures). These events are designed to give an insight into Parliament's people, processes, offices, history and culture. They will also give an insight into how Parliament scrutinises specific policy areas.  The events are open to all members of the public, and take place in Parliament and at universities around the UK. This event has been arranged in partnership with ParliAble, Parliament's workplace equality network for disability, with the support of the European Parliament Information Office in the UK."
