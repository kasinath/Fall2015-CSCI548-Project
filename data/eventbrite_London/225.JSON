Join us for this evening event, where Professor John Wyatt will explore biblical, medical and pastoral responses to the challenges raised at the end of life. Christian believers do not need to share in the terrible fears and despair of those in our society who have no hope.  Death is still an enemy but the truth is that, by God?s grace, the process of dying?doesn?t need to be all about loss ? in fact, it can be a time of opportunity and internal growth, even a strange and wonderful adventure. John Wyatt has worked as a consultant neonatologist at University College Hospital for more than 20 years, but is now concentrating on teaching and research into ethical dilemmas raised by advances in technology. He is former Chair of the Medical Study Group of the Christian Medical Fellowship (CMF) and a board member of Biocentre. His books,  and  , are published by IVP."
