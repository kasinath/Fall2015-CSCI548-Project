    "desc": ":? ?(Associate Director, Institute for Criminal Policy Research, Birkbeck, University of London, UK) : Why does punitivity vary across country? Penal practice and public attitudes to punishment in comparative perspective : Mike Hough will present findings from the Fifth European Social Survey on patterns of public attitudes to punishment across the 28 countries participating in the country. He will discuss the relative predictive power of factors such as levels of public trust in justice, levels of attachment to right-wing authoritarian(RWA) views and country-level factors such as income inequality and political structure. Surprisingly, it turns out that country-level factors have only limited predictive power, whilst trust in justice and RWA views are powerful predictors."
