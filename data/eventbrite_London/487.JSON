Departing from Festival Pier, the tour will first go upstream to Nine Elms, taking in Battersea Power Station, and Foster's Studio. Cruising downstream past Michael Hopkins' imposing Portcullis House, iconic Somerset House (Sir William Chambers/Dixon Jones), Renzo Piano's hulking Shard and underneath colourfully lit bridges including Tower Bridge, where a new illumination to mark the 2012 Olympics replaced the first significant illumination of 25 years. The new vertical towers of the City tower above the lower riverbank architecture creating a dramatic skyline from our unique river perspective. Led by specialist guide, an architect?with in-depth knowledge, providing excellent commentary. Booked only for capacity for the inside deck. Departing and returning to Festival Pier. Duration 2.45 hours approx. Regretfully no children under 7."
