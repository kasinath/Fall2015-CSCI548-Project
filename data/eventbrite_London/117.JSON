And what?s the role of leaders in creating an environment in which people feel safe to authentically show up ?whole? to work? ? With input from Mark McKergow, Pilar Orti and Judy Rees, you can expect to be an active participant in a structured workshop where you?ll have the chance to connect with a mixture of interesting people, including many who are actively engaged in reinventing their own organisations. ? Ultimately, this network aims to invite the practical adoption of these approaches by RSA Fellows, their organisations - and perhaps even the RSA itself. ? Join us to make something happen!?The event is free but please book your place. Tea and coffee will be available on arrival. If you have any questions, please contact Judy Rees   or by  ."
