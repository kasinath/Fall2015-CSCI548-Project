    "desc": "After a hugely successful event in 2015, we've been invited back to do it all again at Clapham Common. This event is slightly different from the others ? a 5km or 10km route, flat running that?s easy on the ankles, nearly our full range of obstacles, and just throwing distance from the London Underground. We know of no other event which brings a range of obstacles so massive, so ambitious, and so much fun into the centre of London. We'll be taking the legendary Travelator with us to the doorstep of millions of Londoners, and giving you had the opportunity to bring your favourite TV game show memories into reality. If you?ve always fancied taking part in one of our events, but getting there has been too much of a task, then this is the one for you. To see what you?ll be taking on, check out the obstacles here:"
