    "desc": "Light in the Darkness: A Good Christmas Rowan Williams St Paul?s Cathedral, Tuesday 8 December, 6.30 ? 8.00pm Admission Free Christmas is one of the defining points of the year for all Christians, and one of the most difficult festivals to keep spiritually. Amongst all the parties and presents, the busyness and expectations, can we find a way to the heart of the feast and experience anew the extraordinary story of the birth of God in human form, coming to earth as a vulnerable baby born to a poor family in a dark time? ? And if we can, what on earth does it mean? The early church debated passionately who Jesus really was ? God, human, or both ? and it?s still the question on which our faith turns: who was born in that stable, and how does it matter to our lives today? ? Rowan Williams will explore the meanings of Christmas, the darkness and strangeness of the story at the beginning of our faith as well as its message of eternal joy and hope. He will also offer suggestions about how we might reclaim Christmas for our spiritual lives. ? Rowan Williams is the Master of Magdalene College, Cambridge,and was formerly both Archbishop of Canterbury and Professor of Theology at Oxford University.A prolific author, two of his recent books are? Being Christian ? and ? Choose Life: Christmas and Easter Sermons ."
