Well we   go on but!....why not come and see for?yourself? The Legion's Christmas Celebration at Guildhall returns for a night of carols, champagne and celebrities!? Join us for two options - either come along to the Concert only in the grandeur of the Great Hall (and enjoy a drink beforehand in the atmospheric Crypts) or stay afterwards?for?a relaxing and fun?delicious black-tie dinner in the Old Library and with a glass of champagne in the Livery Hall.??? Absolutely fabulous!"
