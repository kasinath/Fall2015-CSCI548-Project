We empower and enable the non-technical community with the tools, knowledge and connections that will help bring their idea to life and visually communicate it through prototyping. ProtoHack will be a 12-hour experience where you will build a prototype that communicates an idea visually. Learn more about ProtoHack by? visiting our website ."
