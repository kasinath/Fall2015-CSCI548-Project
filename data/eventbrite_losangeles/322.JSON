    "desc": "LavaLock is an affordable, bluetooth-connected bike lock that you've been waiting for. Never fumble with keys or a code again. LavaLock secures automatically as you leave your bike, and unlocks when you return. Pinpoint is a platform that enables you to share memorable experiences with friends through the use of photo pins on a map. You upload photos to your own personal map, and they are pinned to the location they were taken. You can share your map with friends so they can see what you've been up to and utilize your photos as recommendations for things to do nearby."
