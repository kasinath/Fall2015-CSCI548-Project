Augustus Tolton, the United States? first African-American priest. Born a slave in Missouri in 1854, Augustus Tolton escaped with his mother and brother to Illinois as a boy. Rejected by every seminary in the United States, he went to Rome to study and be ordained. Once a priest, Fr. Tolton was sent back to his hometown of Quincy, and later to Chicago, where his preaching and presence so inspired both black and white Christians that they flocked to his parish. In the face of extreme prejudice and opposition, Fr. Tolton stands as an example of courage and humility. His cause for canonization was presented to the Vatican in 2014 and is moving forward. ?
