    "desc": "January 20th, 2016 is the final date by which you are eligible to transfer your ticket to someone else, or to receive a partial refund for registration cancellations. Tickets cancelled before October 1st, 2015 will receive a refund less 25% of your purchased ticket price; tickets cancelled between October 1st, 2015 and January 20th, 2016 will receive a refund less 50% of your purchased ticket price. If you need to transfer your ticket to someone else, you must do so by January 20th; there will be a $75 transfer processing fee. Cancellations and transfer requests must be received in writing from the original ticket buyer; send requests to info@wisdom2conference.com. We do not support partial ticket-swaps or ticket sharing of any kind; nor do we prorate ticket costs if you are only able to attend certain conference days; nor can you apply the cost of a ticket to future events. After January 20th, 2016, all tickets are non-refundable and non-transferrable. We suggest you consider investing in travel insurance, in case an extenuating event prevents you from attending. In the unlikely event that the conference is cancelled, we will refund all tickets. We will not, however, be able to refund flight, hotel, or other purchases people may make. All listed speakers are confirmed -- however, sometimes life events such as sickness or death in the family prevent them from making it at the last minute. Speaker cancellations do not affect the cancellation policy. Purchase of a ticket indicates that you have read and agree to comply with this cancellation policy. This policy is subject to change; all registered attendees will be notified of any changes."
