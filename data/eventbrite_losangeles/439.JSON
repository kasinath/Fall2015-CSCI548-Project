    "desc": "The Just Claim It Prayer Experience is now a new youth prayer ministry resource for the local church. Whether one attends the Youth Prayer Conference or not, this resource will provide you with a total resource package that will keep your young people engaged in a 24/7/365 devotion with God. For the celebration, the JCI World Youth Prayer Conference will take place February 17-20 in Ontario, California. We are asking for every church in North America to send at least one attendee for the purpose of training and implementation back home. There is one thing that every attendee will leave with ? ?A Ministry?. A special feature ?The Call to Ministry? will provide a daily opportunity for youth and young adults to connect with selected pastors to talk about the possible call to the full-time Gospel Ministry and the Call to Lay Ministry. Youth Ministries of Southeastern California Conference wants to provide our young people with the opportunity to attend. As an incentive for registering early, we are offering $100 off for the first 100 people who will register. This amount is only good for 4 people in a room. We want to encourage our leaders and our churches to register your youth for this event. Together, we can work towards facilitating change in this world that brings glory and honor to our Father.? You have two options... 1. You can register now and pay the full amount, or 2. Pay a nonrefundable deposit of $20/person and pay the full amount by December 7, 2015. ?If your balance is not paid by December 7, your deposit will be forfeited."
