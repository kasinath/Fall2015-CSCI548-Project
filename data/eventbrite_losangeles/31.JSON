    "desc": "WIF Speaker Series presents \"Inclusion On Screen: Casting for Today?s Audiences\" Of the 100 top-grossing movies of 2014, 21 had a female lead, 17 had a lead person of color, and at the cross-section, 3 had a woman of color in a starring role. Women are slightly better represented in TV at 42% of lead roles, but people of color dwindle at 13%. It?s now common knowledge that the numbers in front of and behind the camera are nowhere near reflective of current demographics, but considering today?s movie-going audiences are both majority women and people of color, why the disparity? In November?s Speaker Series, four top casting directors will give behind the scenes insights into why some images are staying the same, and how they?re finding talent to make the change. Sharon Bialy  is an award winning Casting Director for television, film and theater. Her recent television credits include the AMC series The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, Halt & Catch Fire, and Breaking Bad. In addition Bialy/Thomas has cast Gotham (Fox), the upcoming Vice Principals with Danny McBride (HBO) and Flaked, starring Will Arnett (Netflix). Recent films: Secret In Their Eyes with Julia Roberts, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Nicole Kidman (November release), Black & White, Stretch (directed by Joe Carnahan). Past favorites include Drugstore Cowboy, Point Break, Rudy, Mr. Holland?s Opus, Reign O?er Me, & Red Belt for David Mamet. Favorite past television credits include Phil Spector (HBO), The Unit (CBS), Jericho (CBS), Mind of the Married Man (HBO), and Picket Fences (FOX). Ms. Bialy?s love for theater has been a recurring theme throughout her career. She recently cast CHINA DOLL with Al Pacino premiering on Broadway November 19.
