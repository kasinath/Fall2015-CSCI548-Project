TYC is designed to encourage and challenge junior high and high school students as well as the youth leaders and educators who serve and support them. This event focuses on networking and building healthy student-to-student and ministry-to-ministry relationships. We are convinced that, as the Body of Christ, we are more effective when we serve together.  TYC is a partnered event, and is subsidized by Southern California Youth For Christ, Biola University, Urban Youth Workers Institute, National Network of Youth Ministries, Christian Educators Association International, and others. For updates on TYC 2016, check out  our Facebook page ?and?our  Instagram feed . We will also be updating this page as more information is available, so check back often.
