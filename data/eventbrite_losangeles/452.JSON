    "desc": "After the productive KGI Town Hall a few weeks ago, Dean Casper felt that it would be effective to have a town hall specific to SALS issues.   (I will close the poll on Sunday so that the faculty & staff can review the agenda prior to the town hall). The format of the town hall will be similar to the previous KGI town hall. Please frame your agenda items as what changes would you like to see as well as what is KGI doing well. FOOD WILL BE PROVIDED by Roundtable Pizza. So you MUST respond to the eventbrite by MOnday at noon if you plan on going so that we don't overorder or underorder food. (Please email me dietary restrictions including whether or not you would prefer a salad.)"
