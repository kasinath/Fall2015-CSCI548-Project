The Southern California Latino Policy Center in partnership with Sabio, East LA College, City of Cudahy, City of Huntington Park, and the City of South Gate, proposes to organize a ?hackathon? to bring coders/web developers from the region together to spend a weekend working on software solutions to address these and other challenges facing the residents of the Southeast Cities. These developers will compete in teams to create software solutions (apps) for use by Southeast Cities residents. In addition, Sabio proposes to conduct coding ?classes/workshop? during the Hackathon for any interested residents, particularly targeting ELAC students, interested in tech careers. ?
