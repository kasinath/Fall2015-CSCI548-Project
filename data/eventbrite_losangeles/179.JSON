Our new report,? ?concludes that many of these roles demand both technical and business acumen. This has led to a new class of hybrid jobs emerging in the digital economy, combining programming skills and ?offline skills? such as analysis, design, or marketing. These hybrid jobs are among the fastest growing and best careers in today?s job market?more than 250,000 positions were open in the last year alone. Join us as we explore the key findings of this report and examine broader market trends in education and employment with leading policy makers, economists, and practitioners."
