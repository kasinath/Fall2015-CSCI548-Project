    "desc": "Arcadia Stage proudly presents? The Secret in the Wings , a production filled with?drama, costumes, props, sets, and lighting to brilliant effect. Expect fantastic music and spectacular sets in a show that adapts a handful of lesser-known fairy tales and highlights their aspects of mystery, taking on a darker perspective while still keeping the aura of a fairy tale! Mary Zimmerman?adapts a group of lesser-known fairy tales to create a theatrical work that sets their dark mystery against her signature wit and humor. The framing story concerns a child and the frightening babysitter with whom her parents leave her. As the babysitter reads from a book, the characters in each of the tales materialize, with each tale breaking off just at its bleakest moment before giving way to the next one. Director Whitney LaBarge, producer Stephen Volpe, and the award-winning high school theatre students of Arcadia Stage will present this visual extravaganza in November 2015, geared towards middle school children and above. This show is GUARANTEED to sell out before opening night. ?Don't be left without a ticket, book yours now."
