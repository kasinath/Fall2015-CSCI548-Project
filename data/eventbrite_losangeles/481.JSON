    "desc": "Artists and arts managers are keenly interested in people's perceptions and experiences -- what an artwork meant, or why a performance captured their attention, or how participating in an activity changed their thinking -- the very questions that lend themselves to qualitative approaches and perspectives. In our new Story Finding/Story Telling workshop, we'll introduce and explore the frameworks, vocabulary, and tools that will help you gather and work with rich narrative data. Because where there are numbers . . . we also need words! Facilitated by?Kamella Tate, MFA, EdD"
