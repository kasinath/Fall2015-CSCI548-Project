    "desc": "God did not design ministry for just a few with seminary degrees. At Saddleback, we believe that every member is a minister. During 301 you will learn how God can use your  piritual Gifts, your  eart (passions), your  bilities, your  ersonality and your  xperiences to minister to the needs of others. When you choose to follow Christ, you were given special abilities, known as Spiritual Gifts. God gave you these gifts for you to use to build up His Church. God also gave you passion for particular activities and subject. Having the   for specific things, people or circumstances is to be used to guide us into a ministry that we really care about.  In 301, you will be shown how to assess your abilities, gifts and passions to see where in ministry you will love to serve. Location: Palladium Ballroom floor Parking: Palladium (free parking)  Time: 2:00-6:00 PM  Dinner will be provided."
