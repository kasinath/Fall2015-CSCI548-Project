Wearables, advanced materials, e-commerce, data science, biometrics and tech-infused avant-garde couture are all part of a wave of innovation that will revolutionize the $1.2T global fashion industry. Come get on the ground floor. GRID110, the Standard Hotel and the LA UX Meetup are joining forces to host one of the coolest Hackathons you'll ever see. Hackers will spend the night at the iconic DTLA hotel to come up with a FashionTech wearables prototype. Teams of 4 will present their prototype to a killer panel of judges, and the top teams will walk away with some amazing prizes! We're looking for fashion designers, programmers, engineers and industry market specialists. Unlike other Hacks, teams will not only mock up a Minimally Viable Product (MVP), but explain how their idea will penetrate and dominate the market. Judging will take place at a cocktail mixer where Hackers can show their prototype, meet other cool techies and unwind after a crazy night. Sign up and let's get you on a team!
