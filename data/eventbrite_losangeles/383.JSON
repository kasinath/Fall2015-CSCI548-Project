    "desc": "The Watershed Conservation Authority, in partnership with North East Trees, and as part of its vision of ?Connecting Communities Through Nature?, is launching the development of a Visionary Urban Greening Master Plan for the Gateway Cities and Lower LA and San Gabriel Rivers.? The Urban Greening Plan seeks to expand access to and development of greenways, parks, and access points along our river corridors, and also extend greening projects throughout our urban communities through identification of complete street opportunities that provide multi-benefits to Cities, Neighborhoods, and individuals.? The plan will, incorporating existing plans and public input, identify new and improved park, trail, bikeway, water conservation and capture, complete streets, tree cover, and interpretive and way-finding opportunities within the 26 cities and unincorporated areas that make up the Gateway Cities region."
