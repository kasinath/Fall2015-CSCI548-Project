Loved Hamilton. Beware, however, of pick pocketers. I was standing alone and a man came up next to me and pretended to be with me. He had on earphones and was singing gospel music. The minute the line started moving, he pretended his date hadn't showed up and left the line. I really think he was waiting for me to let down my guard. I put on my earphones and ignored him so it was clear he wasn't with me. Be careful!"},{"review":"Recently refurbished and quite nice. Saw Hamilton there. Loved the play, but for a 6 foot man, the seats are tight with little leg room. I am sure it was originally designed for shorter people years ago, but if it were not for the fantastic play, it would have been difficult to last thru two hours+."},{"review":"Upon arriving at RRT will call, we produced the email confirmation of our tickets for Hamilton. We were told in a very unhelpful manner that we needed to leave the theater and print the tickets out. We tried reasoning with the employee by saying that it was obvious that we had paid (summarily) for these tickets. While that was obvious to him, he still (taking pleasure in his position of power) made us run to the Marriott to have them printed. Fortunately, the concierge at the Marriott was accostomed to helping patrons of the RRT because it happens several times a day. So, instead of helping HIS paying customers he helped customers of another business (RRT) print their tickets. We made it back to the theater with one minute to spare and no one ever scanned or collected them. I don't understand why the employee at will call HAD to have a printed copy. What a shame that anything should detract fom the incredible, unbelievable performance that happens when Hamilton begins."},{"review":"Clean, good view from the seats.

My husband is 6'4\" and his knees were hitting his chin. No leg room. Thankfully, the couple on the aisle offered to trade seats. New York at its finest. Thank you!"},{"review":"I have learned from experience that most Broadway theaters are poor quality, easy to get trampled on as what happened to me this time and you feel like a sardine when you are seated. Still they put on the best productions you would want to see and Hamilton is no exception. Now playing at the Richard Rodgers theater.\n\nIt is not often that I get to see a new musical on Broadway but this time I got the original cast! I had purchased my ticket 3 months prior to my visit and had a seat on the left side of the first balcony. I had a great view of the stage along with the turntable used I would imagine to mark the passing of time or events.\n\nWritten and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton the show is completely sung in rap music so you need to listen carefully to the lyrics in order to follow the story line.\n\nLeslie Odom Jr stars as Aaron Burr who keeps reminding Hamilton that all his \"talking\" will eventually lead to trouble. The story follows the life of Hamilton from the Revolutionary war, the aftermath, and what eventually led to his famous duel with Aaron Burr.\n\nI loved watching the \"Schuyler sisters\" number. They seemed reminiscent of the 3 daughters of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nJonathan Groff provides standout comic relief as King George with the audience singing to his da da da da medley.\n\nCourse one of my favorite actors was Daveed Diggs in two different roles. First, he played Lafayette and later Thomas Jefferson. He had me going in stitches.\n\nThere is much action going on throughout the show with minor characters so like a circus it is hard to see everyone at the same time but the spotlight always stays on the principal characters doing the singing.\n\nI had to get the original cast cd since it contains the libretto to the story. The turntable really adds to the production since they can shift characters around easily.\n\nPlease note that Hamilton the musical contains explicit content which may not be appropriate for all audiences. \n\nThe cast joins as a whole for the curtain call as opposed to bringing them out individually leading to the starring role. I found that very unique.\n\nAll in all I was thrilled at the opportunity to see it and have a great time to HAM it up!"},{"review":"The performance of Hamilton was remarkable.

Perfect place to see Hamilton, the musical. We were up in the oxygen seats, upper left balcony, row A. Row A is perfect.

Even though we were high, we could see and hear everything. Lovely venue."},{"review":"We went to see Hamilton. Great show. Amazing. However, the seats are crammed in super tight and very steep.

Featuring a cast of both hearing and deaf actors, the entire show is both fully-sung and fully signed or otherwise interpreted. The roles played by deaf actors have \"voices,\" who appear on stage and sing and supply dialogue from the shadows. The effect is mesmerizing. All of the performances are raw, real and completely fearless. Duncan Sheik's Tony winning music remains hauntingly beautiful, and the story, somehow, becomes even more heartbreaking in the hands of this company of largely unknown actors--nearly 2\/3 of the company is making their Broadway debuts. If you want to see a show that will make you think and feel, this is the show for you.\n\nNote: If you are not already aware, the subject matter of the play is a group of provincial German teenagers from the 1800's discovering their sexuality--on their own, as none of the adults in the community will speak with them about such an \"inappropriate\" topic. This innocence\/ignorance leads to the complications that drive the plot. Because sex, and how we deal with it, is the central subject of the show, it is very, very frank in its depictions and discussions--this is a wonderful show, but it it NOT a show for sensitive audiences or children."},{"review":"The Brooks Atkinson Theatre is a beautiful venue - every seat has a great view of the stage.

If you manage to get in and out around the dangerous step up you have to attempt to actually USE the restroom. Someone didn't measure twice, cut once. There is no clearance between the toilet and the door to the stalls. One needs to almost stand on the bowl to exit the stall!

We were told that the side box seats were the best value at $35 each compared to $100+ elsewhere in the theater. The only drawback if any was a slight obstruction of the extreme corners of the stage.

Spring Awakening is not for everyone, the couple next to us left at intermission and from their body language they appeared to be offended. A lot of the actors are deaf so at times there are two actors performing the same role on stage at the same time. It seems strange at first but it worked out great.

We took in Skylight starring Bill Night and Carey Mulligan which was excellent. The theatre itself was compact but views from everywhere are excellent. The facilities are good but space around the back is limited, there did seem to be issues surrounding the ladies toilets. The upstairs bar in particular is somewhat cramped with next to no seating. The doors only opened around half an hour before the show started and all the staff go out of their way to remind you that no drinks can be taken into the show, even conducting extremely thorough searches. The barman in particular was keen to stress that drinking time was limited. Overall though the ticket price was reasonable and the experience well worth it."},{"review":"This was a fascinating experience for regular London theatre goers - our first visit to a Broadway theatre. We saw Skylight, a transfer from London with Bill Nighy and Carey Mulligan, at this 1927 theatre. A few things surprised us comparing the experience to London - they only opened the theatre about 25 minutes before curtain up and there was so little public space - the foyer was virtually non-existent. The staff also seemed extremely fussy about visitors taking anything into the theatre food and drink related and all women's handbags were searched on the way in for rogue bottles of water! The barman was extremely officious about telling us that we couldn't take drinks into the auditorium. During the interval, one of the officials spent ten minutes to get the queue for the ladies' loo in a different direction to the one the women had chosen for themselves! The theatre itself is quite small and plainly decorated and is pretty tight on legroom. The audience was attentive and knowledgeable about theatre and the cast got a good reception. So, overall, a fascinating experience, although the tickets were considerably more expensive than commercial London Theatre."},{"review":"On February 14 2015 my wife attended a Delicate Balance and watched from seats on the third row. The two main actors, Glen Close and John Lithgow are truly excellent actors and their spontinaity deserves accolades. \nHowever, the play is a complete bomb. No acting could overcome a ridiculous plot and bad writing. We should have walked out at the first intermission but for some illogical reason we thought it had to get better. It never did. \nSave your time and money see a musical."},{"review":"I went to go see the show \"A Delicate Balance\" at the Golden Theatre in New York City. The theatre is absolutely gorgeous it has gilded and ornate fixtures. The theatres acoustics are fantastic for performances which I think has something to do with it being the perfect sized performance space for an intimate Broadway show. The theatre was extremely clean and well kept. Downstairs where the bathrooms are located they have a well stocked bar for either before, after or during intermission enjoyment. The staff are very helpful and organized getting you in and out and to your seat with ease. The set designers are awesome and magicians at there job you actually felt as though you were looking at the living room of a well to do middle class family. I have to mention the production that I saw. This was my first Broadway show my girlfriend surprised me with tickets to \"A Delicate Balance\" starring Glenn Close (Agnes) and John Lithgow (Tobias) it was so amazing to be able to see two iconic award winning actors at the top of there craft. I sat with my girlfriend 3 rows from the front and a couple seats right of center. Glenn Close's portrayal of the family matriarch Agnes was riveting and poignant she embodied her character effortlessly and with a subtle strength that only Glenn Close could evoke Agnes is a strong willed yet fragile woman with an internal struggle based in insecurity and loss. John Lithgow's performance of the family patriarch Tobias was so strong and entrancing with moments of extreme laughter and at times a palpable tension that was so real you felt his characters emotions so much you felt that at any point he might break. Lindsay Duncan as Agnes in denial laughable alcoholic sister Claire is spectacular. Claire serves as a witness to the families dysfunction making introspective commentaries on life and the journey that has taken them to this particular moment in time. Bob Balban (Harry) & Clare Higgins (Edna) are hilarious as Agnes and Tobias's intrusive very very best friends. Martha Plimpton (Julia) as Agnes & Tobias's daughter is at times manic and other times as fragile as a child. A delicate Balance is only in The Golden Theatre for a limited run of 18 weeks and if you are planning on coming to NYC to see a Broadway show do not pass this up. You will find yourself laughing out loud and at times asking yourself introspective questions about your own life and finally the ending is inspired."},{"review":"Edward Albee's play, A Delicate Balance with Glenn Close and John Lithgow was terrific. The play is 46 years old, but hold up well."},{"review":"The Gin Game, which premiered in 1977 with Hume Cronin and Jessica Tandy, was revived two decades later with Charles Durning and Julie Harris. The play is truly an actor\u2019s vehicle, and the latest version with James Earl Jones and Cicely Tyson starring as Weller Martin and Fonsia Dorsey respectively give rich and nuanced performances. \n\nThe two meet on the porch of an old age home where Weller ventures to teach Fonsia how to play gin rummy. When she consistently wins at the game, Weller\u2019s normally irascible personality becomes apoplectic. The cards reveal some very dark secrets in both their pasts. D.L. Coburn, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning work, probes the questions of aging, poverty, loneliness, failed relationships, and abandonment. \n \n\nTo say these two veterans give a bravura performance is understatement. The audience was on its feet whistling, whooping, and hollering at the final curtain for the remarkable energy and magic between the two stars who are 84 (Jones) and 90 (Tyson). It was heartening to see young teens at the show to see these lions of the stage."}]},{"nearBy":["Majestic Theatre","Imperial Theatre","St. James Theater"]}]},{"WalterKerrTheater.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"218 West 48th Street","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" (212) 239-6200"},{"reviews":[{"review":"Theatre is a wonderful old theatre done in the 1920s style.

We saw one guy that was newer (we asked) who was busting his butt while the others seemed to stroll about not working very hard and they definitely were making him do the grunt work and not treating him very well.

The building has recently been landmarked,\nThe changes made by Marriott are not all good. The new cheap crystal lighting is not as attractive as the traditional old wall sconces - of which only a few are left. The blue neon lighting in the Blue Bar is horrendous and serving cocktails in a jar or a tin is not my idea of high style\nHaving said that the new suites are attractive and probably worth the extra cost as the standard rooms are generally very small. The bathroom was bit small but adequate. The décor included a large backlit photo of old NY - a nice touch. Wifi is efficient and free.\nHowever our safe didn't function properly and we had to call Security to break it open to get our stuff out. Also during our stay one lift did not work - this caused enormous waits on all 12 floors as there are only two lifts in total. Additionally one lift is continually in use by staff as there is no separate service elevator.\nFinally the breakfast was poor and expensive - and I recommend you check your food bill carefully..

Then we boarded escalators to arrive at the third floor where there was even more confusion. Multiple long winding lines to enter the theatre, lines with no demarcation, lines that intersected each other, lines that intersected with the ladies room line...and to compound matters, a VERY loud yelling attendant was running everywhere telling people to move away from this area, move away from that area, etc. No benches for those with mobility issues (like my husband) to sit and wait while a partner stood on line. If stairs are a problem don't ever buy a balcony ticket here - a long winding staircase is the only way to get to those seats. This is a very large theater - 1600 seats - and I attended on a full house day. That shouldn't be an excuse. The theatre entrance area was just not properly set up and organized to ensure the comfort and safety of theatregoers. ( I shudder to think of what would have happened if all of these people had to suddenly exit.) Maybe that's why the attendants were so stressed - and why I was so stressed by the time I got to my seat. Once inside, the theatre and seats were fine, but I'm a Marriott Rewards member and I have come to expect a lot from the Marriott name.

The show was wonderful; however, the theatre was not to code. First, there was no toilet paper in either stall in the ladies bathroom. There was also no soap. With about 15 minutes left of the show, someone in the show yelled that someone was going to get bit by a rat. I was two rows in front of this man. There was a rat that was running around towards the front of the theatre. The rat was running around and squealing. He was leaving droppings everywhere. My boyfriend and I had to get up and leave because we were afraid to get bit. This is a violation of health codes, and I was petrified. Not only did I spend 4.5 hours driving to NYC specifically to see this show, I also spent $75 a ticket off of ticketmaster, and we did not even get to see the end of the show. This was the worst theatre building I have been to, and I have traveled most of the US and have seen many shows.\nIt is too bad because most people in the theatre left early, and it is unfortunate because STOMP is such a good show."},{"review":"forestillingen \"Stomp\" var fantastisk...max. antal stjerner.

Seaport (about 6 blocks away) and might be a nice way to head south without taking a subway or cab if you're going to downtown east. The ferry is only $3.50 one way but happens to be free from 34th to Wall Street. I took the \"Seastreak\" line. You pay on board but if you're going to wall street it's free, and then we paid on a new boat used when we transferred at Wall St. Ferry terminal.\n\nThe boat continues onto the Brooklyn Army terminal and then under the Verrazano Bridge to the Rockaway Ferry Terminal in the eastern part of the Rockaway peninsula. You pass Coney Island and the Brooklyn beach and Jamaica Bay into the Rockaway terminus.\n\nOverall it's a great relaxing ride, that is not crazy crowded and you get to see both the Manhattan skyline and the Brooklyn seaside (including Coney Island) from a water perspective. \n\nThe ride should only get better with warmer weather. It's cheap, (fun) and has tons of photo op material all along the way."},{"review":"Plenty of beach to enjoy, but sections (Beach 87th St to Beach 107 St.) are still closed because of erosion from Superstorm Sandy. The restrooms and food vendors are still there and they have improved the areas around these. Unfortunately most of the boardwalk is gone. Still a lot of work to be done but it won't stop you from enjoying the beach."},{"review":"If you are coming to the Rockaways from, well, anywhere else, you should plan on spending a whole day. Of course, the beach is the main draw, and there is lots of it. The undertow can be very strong in some places, so use caution and only swim when the excellent (award winning!) life guards are on duty. I always feel the water is cleaner here than in Coney Island\/Brighton Beach.\n\nStrolling on the board walk and people watching is also great fun because of the Rockaways' great \"boardwalk culture.\" You can watch surfers and other forms of exhibitionists, and there are often concerts and other events during the summer. All body types are prevalent. Sadly, the boardwalk took a beating during Hurricane Sandy, as did many businesses and homes.\n\nFor some greenery, visit the Beach 91st Street Community Garden, which was built by locals out of a plot of demolished homes, or Tribute Park on 116th Street, a memorial to 9\/11 victims. Tribute Park is particularly moving at sunset when the Manhattan skyline seems so remote. It can be a heart stirring experience if you get a chance to speak with locals visiting the memorial. Finally, I highly recommend ending your visit at the Wharf, which is by Tribute Park. It's not a trendy hipster spot like the Taco place, and the outdoor seating is great, especially if you want to linger over drinks and watch the sky change colors. \n\nI haven't been, but have heard positive things about Thai Rock http:\/\/www.thairock.us\/\nThey have live music and have been good neighbors to the Rockaways community."},{"review":"This is a hidden gem except for the people who live near there. A real taste of ocean living that is a train ride away from most people in the city, a bit of a ride but a great spot to visit. The beach is very nice and there are numerous concession stands to eat at and free showers to get the sand of your legs and torsos. Lifeguards are there to protect you and I really like it when a storm comes in and you can see the power of the surf displaying is majesty with white caps and wind. Great spot for a beach party as well."}]},{"nearBy":["Rockaway Beach","Andrew J.

Tickets are very reasonably priced and the entire Lincoln Center experience is a very elegant evening."},{"review":"We went here in July to see Cinderella and what a fantastic production it was. \n\nThe Lincoln Centre is beautiful and a great venue for this type of production. The costumes and set design as well as the choreography were fantastic. \n\nThe casts will always vary in standard but there were some standouts. Cassandra Trenary as the Fairy Spring and the Prima Ballerina playing Cinderella were divine. The young man dancing as the Jester far outshone the lead male dancer. \n\nA great company, great venue and well worth a visit."},{"review":"We attended the June 25, 2015 performance of Swan Lake at the Met. It was the Most spectacular performance I have ever attended. If you are looking for a ballet with lovely costumes, the most exquisite dances EVER, and a lovely locations - this is it. We were transported into the story and hated to see the evening end. Our hats off to the dances, orchestra (violin solos - Bravo) and scene creators, it is obvious you are all masters of your crafts. Bravo bravo bravo. We were moved to tears. There dancers combined dance with acting to make the story come to life in I way we never thought possible."},{"review":"We went to Romeo and Juliet while in NYC. We had seen traveling ballet companies before but nothing of this caliber. The fight scene was executed with perfect precision with the swords providing percussion for the music. There was a full orchestra which was excellent! We sat in the balcony, but had an unobstructed view and loved it. It was half the price if a Broadway show and twice as good."},{"review":"It pains me to write a negative review of ABT at the Met, but I would like to share an important seating tip. With few seats available at the last minute, I bought two tickets to \"Sleeping Beauty\" -- Grand Tier, Box 30, seats 4 and 5. Perhaps I should have known better, as I have been to the Met before (but never in a box seat), and the online ticketing noted that these were \"partial view\" seats. In fact, there was no view at all. Literally. I could not see the stage because of the angle and the patrons (in box seats 1, 2, 3) in front of me. I am not exaggerating. I tried standing, kneeling on my chair, etc. With some contortions, a sliver of the stage was visible. My husband (6' 2\") could see a bit when he stood up. We left at intermission because there was really no point in staying. I am extremely disappointed that these seats were sold for the ballet, where a view of the stage is essential."},{"review":"ABT is a large company that performs in several locations. It is really two companies in one. The permanent part has had its ups and downs over a long period of time; right now it is decidedly on the way down owing to retirements that have not been replaced with dancers on the same level and more than one principal dancer who would not make that grade elsewhere. (An outstanding exception is the great Polina Semionova, who has gone from being a guest artist to a regular member of the company.) \n\nEvery late spring\/early summer ABT has a season at the Metropolitan Opera House, to which it brings famous dancers, like Roberto Bolle, Natalia Osipova, and Diana Vishneyva from abroad. Although ABT does do some seriously imaginative work, its staple is the long 19th century story ballet, and for this reason it is more dependent on the quality of its stars than for example, the New York City Ballet. Sometimes this works out very well, as in Osipova's brilliant, deeply moving Giselle in May. But ballet necessarily involves injuries (and indeed Ms. Osipova was injured close to the end of her performance), and so there must be replacements. Semionova had to withdraw from all five of her appearances this summer, and instead of seeing her in La Bayadere I was subjected to a colorless in-house hack.For the following performance, however, the audience got the splendid Maria Kotchekova as a substitute. The point is that you may do a lot of planning and possibly go to considerable expense only to have the kind of experience that I did with Bayadere. ABT is capable of finding first-rate substitutes but doesn't always do so."},{"review":"A night at the Met. We were very fortunate to buy tickets to the American Ballet Theatre's production of \"Giselle\" last night. An absolute treat after too many productions of \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Swan Lake\" by so many other ballet companies. Then there's \"Nutcracker\",ad nauseum, by every ballet troupe in the Country every holiday season. Sorry if I offend parents whose kids are in this year's production.\n\nThe sets, lighting, and music were beautiful. But of course it's all about the dancers. ABT lived up to it's reputation as the best America has to offer. The principles were great, of course. But I was totally impressed by the corps de ballet, 20 young women who danced as if they were one...Bravo! \n\nFour curtain calls for the entire troupe and then seven for Giselle and Count Albrecht.\n\nThis was an evening of pure magic."},{"review":"ABT probably does not need another review. It is clear that one expects excellence from this troupe. \nWe went to see a matinee ballet. Three acts: Company B, Monotones I and II, and Green Table. Do not despair if you are late. Company B is a bit of a mumble about the popular music during the II World War. Unconvincing bordering on boring choreography. The second and the third acts were a true redemption!"}]},{"nearBy":["Union Square Greenmarket","St. Patrick's Old Cathedral","Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site"]}]},{"Studio54.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"254 West 54th Street","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" +1 212-719-1300"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"Amazing theatre.

That is if you like being outside (biking and mini-golf etc), and enjoy history as much as I do (nerd!). Castle Williams is a great example of the history this preserved urban time-capsule has to offer up. The fort was built between 1807 and 1812 to keep those pesky Britts from taking New York back, as war of 1812 was brewing (see I am a history nerd). The architecture was innovative; it was built to be round as opposed to a five pointed star (Fort Jay, the larger fortification on the island is a perfect example of a classic five pointed fort). What this meant was a full 360 degree view of the harbor, and a harder target to hit. They loaded the place up with 100+ cannons, and pointed them towards the mouth of the Hudson. This must have been one hell of a scary sight to any war ships, as none even tried to sail up the river. \n\nOk history class is over, what's this place like now a days? Well now it's all about the historical significance of the structure, but from the 60's to the 90's the Coast Guard was I'm charge. Aside from killer storage, they turned it into (I'm not kidding) the scariest haunted house in the world. Forgetting for a moment the flagrant waste of government money, this has to be the funniest thing I've ever heard. Can you imagine walking into a 200 year old fort, finding dry ice smoke creeping out of cells, and dudes with chainsaws trying to scare the crap out of each other? Awesome, I say bring this back as an event this year. \n\nCastle Williams is an awesome place to visit, absolutely worth seeing while visiting the island.

The VIP tickets that I purchased may or may not have been the wisest decision that I made, but that is on me. At $50 they included \"no wait\" entry and the head set that added commentary as you walked through the exhibits. We arrived at Discovery Times Square at 9 am only to find out that it wasn't opening until 10. Not sure if that was because Daylight Savings time went into effect the day before but they did have someone at the door to tell us it would not open until 10. When we returned at 10 there were maybe 10 others waiting so I didn't really need any VIP ticket to skip ahead in line. The head set and computer-like gizmo was very cool but the staff, although very friendly, didn't really have a lot of time to explain how it worked so I struggled a little. It did have some amazing features that included taking pictures of exhibits or even selfies that were then sent to your e-mail free of charge. Also, there may be more than one sound bite in each room so be sure to play them all. I did not realize this until about half way through. The best part of having $50 VIP Tickets was the fact that it forced me to make the trip from rural Ohio to New York City and I am so glad that I did. I had allotted 2 hours to see this exhibition but spent just under 4 hours. Seeing the sets and costumes was a once in a life time experience that I am so glad I had the opportunity to see. There were also many inter-actives along the way that included standing at the game maker's table and operating mutts and using your handheld to see a hologram. My favorite was the map of Panem that allowed you to choose each district and see photos of tributes from each along with info about what the district manufactured or their contribution to the Capitol. There were even some sets that did not make it into the movies such as the hydroponic lab from District 13. I loved seeing Effie's dresses up close. So many favorites that I can't list them all. My friend that came with me is not such a fan, although I gave her the movies to watch before our trip, said that she enjoyed it as well. I think she would have finished in 2 hours though. If you go you may be interested to know that there are also other exhibits in the same building. While we were there it also featured Body Works and Agents of Marvel. Coming soon is a new Star Wars exhibit. The Hunger Games will be on display until January 1, 2016. If you have The New York Pass it includes entry to the Discovery Times Square so you can save $50.

Let me tell you many of the buffet customers are your biggest bettors, say good bye to them."},{"review":"I'm a big horse racing fan so was really looking forward to a visit to Aqueduct, we went via the subway \/ metro from midtown New York and the track is almost next to the station, admission is free and around an hour and a half before the first race you can buy racecards and papers with all the runners and form etc.\n\nThe track is the standard flat circular American layout ( at some periods of the year they race on the inside turf track ).\n\nMy only real disappointment was the paddock \/ winners enclosure area which is on a lower level to the spectators so you are looking down on the horses and are not really in any proximity to them.\n\nThe crowd were a mixed bunch and some of the shouts of encouragement were a clue we weren't at Royal Ascot but if you go upstairs to the seats it is much quieter and viewing of the races is good.\n\nFood and beverage prices are disgusting ie $12 for a bottle of beer or $4.50 for a coffee so take your own."},{"review":"Our first trip to the casino during our recent visit to NY, and not as many degenerates as you might think. Not crowded this weekday, clientele consisted of mostly middle age to mature Asian couples and grandmas. The ponies weren't running this day, but the track looks like it probably did 30 years ago; after all it is a race track. The casino itself was nicely appointed, 2 floors of gaming, large bar and stage with TV screen backdrop for all of your live performance and sports type needs, restrooms EXTREMELY clean, and fully stocked. Shocked by the free parking. Food prices would have been way over priced had we not been in a casino, or in NY. So, for a casino in NY food was perfectly overly inflated 300%. Best bet to make while visiting Aqueduct is on the Sabrett girl, got a \"dirty dog\", chip, and a soda- $5. Cage lines were long, and employees are clueless, we only stayed long enough for the penny slots to mug $30 out of my wallet- about an hour."},{"review":"My wife and I were interested in visiting a casino in or around New York during our first visit to the city from Australia and expected that we would have made a day trip to Atlantic City but once in New York, after some research, found reference to the Resorts World Aquedeck Casino. We decided to use the A train to get there from Manhattan and had no difficulties in folowing the directions. The day was clear and warm, so we did not need to use the shuttle bus from the station - the walk was probably only three hundred meteres.\nWe had been to the Resorts World casino at their home at the Genting Highlands in Malaysia and found it to be cramped, full of smoke and not a particularly pleasant environment for enjoying the slots.\nIn this case, we were pleasantly surprised, by the amount of space between banks of machines, the clean atmosphere and general presentation of the place, as well as a huge range of modern machines. The food outlets were good and reasonably priced and the restrooms clean and spacious.\nWe had some wins and seemed to get a return that was better than we have experienced in other casinos. Overall, for a lot less trouble and effort that going from Manhattan to Atlantic City, this provided us with an enjoyable day out, an opportunity to see someting more of Long Island and an opportunity to see another Genting-run casino. I would recommend this as a good option for anyone wanting to try their luck while in New York."},{"review":"For a RACINO I was surprised on how dirty the race track was. The casino was nice and clean but the race track side was a dump. They also charged $5 for a 20 ounce soda and $9 for a cheeseburger. Glad I went once but never again."},{"review":"The place is overcrowded with too many people. The paper from their bets are all the ground everywhere. Some people are rude , obnoxious, and made because they didn't win. Overpriced concession products.People stand up blocking your view point during the race. You cannot say anything to them because they want to argue with you. I will not visit this place again.It is well known . Save your time and money and visit somewhere else."},{"review":"The buffet is unbelievable,you can have something from almost every country,and the desserts are to die for! The machines seemed very loose on the day Iwas there,we all won."},{"review":"We went here for the casino and buffet. The casino staff were very friendly and you get bonus cash for every membership card to other casinos you bring. The buffet was good but the service staff was a bit slow. The directions to get there via the subway were a little vague. It says to take the \"A\" train to the Aqueduct stop but there are different \"A\" trains so make sure you get on the right one. Also the skywalk was not open yet but they do provide a shuttle."},{"review":"A good add for NYers. No more long drive and expensive hotel stay at Atlantic city. It's a great place for people who want to spend couple of hours playing slots and leave anytime they want compare to the long hours wait for the returning bus pick up at AC. It helps to budget your gaming money."}]},{"nearBy":["Marvelous Manhattan Tours","Cinemart Cinemas","Long Island Rail Road"]}]},{"GladstoneGallery.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"516 West 24th Street","postalCode":"10011","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212\/206-9300"},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":["Gagosian Gallery","Agora Gallery","I Heart NY Photography - Tours"]}]},{"ChinesePorcelainCompany.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"475 Park Ave","postalCode":"10022-1669","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 838 7744"},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":["59E59 Theaters","Christ Church","Metamorphosis Day Spa"]}]},{"TaipeiGalleryandTheater.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"1221 Ave of the Americas","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 373 1850"},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":["Top of the Rock Observation Deck","Radio City Music Hall","Cort Theatre"]}]},{"BlockBeautiful.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"19th Street Between 3rd Ave. & Irving Pl","postalCode":"10003","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"Il Block Beautiful è un grazioso quartiere che si trova sulla 19th Street nelle vicinanze di Gramercy Park, il parco privato il cui accesso è permesso solo agli esponenti della high society residenti nella zona.

After you go through the standard these days security checkpoints you slowly venture towards your elevator ride to the top. The elevator is probably nothing like you've ever experienced before. Three sides of the elevator are screens which provide the illusion that you are taking a glass elevator ride all the way to the 102nd floor.

Initially frustrated by this you enter an area with a screen in front of you where the video talks briefly about NYC and just when you think let's get on with this the screens slowly rise to reveal the city views below. What a great idea to introduce you to the view. Then you're set free to explore in 360 views of the city. There are several places to grab food or drink there.

There are some artifacts, such as an old street lamp. My favorite thing was a replica of the ball that is dropped on New Years. It is also lit and gives quite a light show. There are some costumes of the interesting characters who also make Times Square unique. They don't have anything beyond 2001, like a picture of the naked cowboy, probably because he still \"performs\" daily near by.

The Dutch stood for freedom of speech, freedom of religion. With its \"live and let live\" acceptance of social and cultural differences, it shaped American political and religious development, competition and trade. It was the Dutch Origins of American Religious Liberty, Diversity and Toleration in Colonial Dutch North America that set the tone.\n\nNew York City is the most linguistically and religious diverse City in the world. Its inhabitants communicate in some 800 different languages across the five boroughs. New Yorkers attend approximately 2000 churches and 4000 informal places of worship making its total 6000. The City has more than 1000 synagogues and more than 100 mosques. In my many years living in Manhattan I have visited hundreds of churches, synagogues, mosques and have enjoyed its brilliant architecture, its history and how it shaped neighborhoods throughout the City. It is a true journey of often going back in time, how these many places of worship have put a stamp on what America is today.\n\nTemple Emanu-El is the largest Jewish House of Worship in the world and of such magnificence. The façade of the building features an arch which symbols representing the 12 tribes of Israel. It was founded mainly by German Jewish immigrants. I have attended services over many years and have felt the pain, the joy, the sorrows in the voices of the cantors and its over 5774 years of history expressed through songs of its ancient history to modern times.\n\nWith such diversity, such cross the border culturing, all available on the Island of Manhattan and its 5 boroughs, anyone can take a time machine, go back in time and learn a great deal about America and its people and what makes this country so great."},{"review":"Perhaps the largest synagogue in the world, the main sanctuary is huge, seating 2,500 people. It is not flashy, but rather exudes class and elegance. The stained glass windows are impressive but the stage area is the real star, with the ark and its surroundings a scene of quiet beauty. A small historical display is located next to the side entrance."},{"review":"I stopped in to see the museum on the 2nd floor and learned a bit about the history of the congregation, one of the oldest in the nation. The exhibit itself is not large but is formidable. Incredible artifacts are on display, speaking to a long and special relationship of some past members of the temple. Then went downstairs and into the sanctuary...... takes ones breath away, it is so beautiful, ethereal, tranquil, quiet...... Next time we are in town, we will need to attend services for sure."},{"review":"This is the world's largest Jewish house of worship. We attended the Saturday morning service and stayed for the tour. Summer services are held in the smaller side chapel. The organ recital begins 15 minutes before the service. The choir and cantor were fabulous and added so much to the meaningfulness of the liturgy. It was a blend of English and Hebrew with English translation at hand. The service was too long for our toddler but Central Park is right across the street so she could look over the wall at the zoo animals or play in the children's playground at 67th street. Our family re-joined for the tour.\n This is what most visitors talk about. The architecture is spectacular; the mosaics are splendid. The mosaic work was done by a female American artist. Another couple on our tour said they were equal to the mosaics at the Blue Mosque in Turkey. The ark in each sanctuary and the giant rose window are beautiful. The website gives you an idea though the massive scale and medieval feel has to be experienced. http:\/\/www.emanuelnyc.org\/"},{"review":"I am a new yorker, and the only time I went into emanu-el, I was met with typical upper east side arrogance.

The historical records in the lobby were very interesting but the photographs unfortunately revealed that this building replaced the much finer Astor Mansion."},{"review":"I had visited this synagogue as an 18 year old but with age developed a clearer understanding of its religious and historical urban context. It is a monument to the aspiring and quickly Integrating prominent wealthy German Jews of Victorian times and their upper east side and suburban successors today . To visit is free and there is no guiding only escorting by a junior security guy. As an add on there is a lovely gallery of modern Jewish art and various artefacts.

It's not that he didn't appreciate the somewhat raunchy humor (we LOVED the 50 Shades musical parody), but he felt the issues were dated. Still, it's a funny show.

We loved that there were beautiful fish instead of horses. While standing there a lady in her 60s walked out and told us that it is so much fun, she had already ridden it twice!!!! She told us that it is so worth the $5 price. We decided to ride it because of her recommendation, and it was the highlight of our morning! We had so much fun! Something so simple, creative and joyful. It is a little different than a horse carousel, because it spins, turns and gently go up and down."},{"review":"This new addition to the Battery Park area was given some fanfare upon opening this summer, and then it slipped under my radar, until recently. What a joy. So sweet and peaceful. I went during the day, but I think a return visit, in the evening, when all the colors will glow on the fish, would be the most ideal time to ride. It's a short three and a half minute ride, but due to the pace of the sea creatures rhythm, it seems rather \"timeless\". According to the people that checked us in, and took our tickets, the fish with the shorter tails go up higher. Really a delight."},{"review":"Almost a religious experience for us. Beautiful luminescent fish go around and up and down randomly to a beautiful soundtrack. You really feel like you are a fish under the sea. We went at night and it was truly breathtaking. I can't believe the reviewer who said a six year old was bored. Hogwash. It was an absolute delight for young and old. $5 was well worth the experience. I'd have paid $10. Never experienced anything like it. On par with the magic of Disney if not even better."},{"review":"Disappointing (yawn) facility located in my note resting waterfront lower Manhattan location. Our grandkids was not interested, and they love other carousels in Central Park, for example."},{"review":"Don't dismiss this ride as being something for children. My husband and I, and 2 older teenage children went on this exquisite carousel after a trip to Ellis Island (it is less that 5 minute walk from ferry terminal) and it was almost the highlight of our day. It doesn't look much from the outside, but riding inside the pastel coloured, translucent glass fish to the strains of Prokofiev is a magical experience."},{"review":"my wife talked me into riding this because we are goofballs and it was alot of fun !! Really pretty and the we noticed all the youngsters were fascinated with this ride."},{"review":"Fun during the day but brilliant once it gets dark. $5 per rider and our 2-year old loved it. About a 3-minute ride, each ride designed with unique pattern of movement and sound. Adults and children riders, a unique experience, and recommend it to anyone. Note, riders 300+ #'s and those in wheelchairs may ride but apparatus is stationary. However, I like that there are alternatives to rides of all kinds! Take your video camera. Enclosed ride but very drafty so you will need your coat. Only negs is that your stroller sits and waits for you outside with no cover or protection. We had no issues, but did lug our purses and camera with us."},{"review":"Just the sheer novelty of this unique carousel warrants a quick visit. I wouldn't make a separate trip to ride it, but if you're at the park catching a ferry to Ellis or Staten Islands, drop in and check it out. Kids love it but it can handle adults too."},{"review":"We were already in the area for other attractions and had heard this Carousel had recently opened. This is a great addition in terms of kid friendly activities in NYC. It's $5 a ticket for a 3 minute ride. The visuals of the glass fish is pretty cool and the kids loved that they went up and down. We went in the afternoon but I can bet that evening is when you want to visit this place. Very unique."},{"review":"This ride cost only $5. My family and I were showing my cousin the sights in the city and she told us about the carousel. I figured why not, and when we got to battery park we rode it. When the ride starts, the fish light up and music plays while you ride to make it feel like you are underwater. I know it's a carousel ride, but we had fun :) And it's $5.

Needs some updating but ambiance makes up for its well worn condition. Loved seeing \"Sylvia\" that is definitely a 5 star play!"},{"review":"The Cort is a real Broadway relic trying its best not to look rundown. Smallish with narrow seats, it has an appalling restroom situation: ladies' rooms are in the basement down a long stairway at the bottom of which a long line of ladies wait for five or six stalls. The balcony is served by a two stall restroom one flight UP a long stairway on the third floor.\n I gave up on that one (ten deep in line during a 12 minute intermission) and knew that by law there had to be a handicapped facility. When I asked an usher she pointed to an unmarked door saying \"down that corridor\". Sure enough, behind the door was an ancient white tiled bathroom with exposed pipes---very turn of the (19th!) century plumbing, peeling paint, etc. That facility is a well kept secret---one must ask to find it. Not sure how a wheelchair client could use that \"handicap\" restroom.. Many line standers were late for the second act due to shortage of facilities. \"Sylvia\" was a good production, but don't go to The Cort if you have any bladder issues!"},{"review":"Wonderful staff, wonderful seating and sound.

The Cort Theatre was previewing \"Sylvia\". Went in to purchase tickets, probably at the back, for a couple of nights later. The very nice gentleman in the box office suggested we might like instead to come at 10.00 am on the morning of the show to try for the cheap last minute seats. We did, and ended up with front row seats! A hiccup when we came that night - the tickets were actually for a different date! The (different) box office attendant was very helpful, and explained that his colleague had realised his mistake and had left the correct tickets ready for us to collect. Very pleased and thrilled by the service, we took our seats in what we could only describe as a lovely character theatre. Loved the show - just great!"},{"review":"The Cort Theatre, as with many NYC theatres is old, but that should not stop anyone from going to see SYLVIA. The play about a man & his dog (played but an extremely talented actress, Annaleigh Ashford) was laugh out loud funny. Obviously, the author knows dogs. I wish that this was video taped for sale, I could watch this over & over. And to be clear, this is not just for women, the gentleman I was sitting next to was equally enjoying this and laughing out with gusto! Of course, we were delighted that Matthew Broderick was the male lead. There are two other actors on stage, and the other male plays three differnt roles. His portrayal of a lady visitor was hysterical."},{"review":"We saw Larry David's Fish in the Dark. It was an amazing show. Every seat was a good view. Nice place for a show"},{"review":"Very good comedy with Jason Alexander in the lead roll. We laughed for two hours. The Cort Theatre is old and yes, the seats are narrow because Americans used to be thinner. Before the show or during the intermission take a good look around and look at the architecture which is absent in modern venues. We sat in row E and were 20 feet from the stage. The show closes in August and we saw seats being sold at TKTS for 50% off. Wedge your butt in one of those seats as you can always sit on a sofa when you get home and have a good time."},{"review":"It's a wonderfully entertaining play...very funny and well written. Great entertainment value. The cast is really great. It's the story of an adopted dog, the part is played by a cute blond and she is wonderful as the dog. You'll be sore from all of the laughter.

It was my first visit and I had expected the museum to be much larger. The art is displayed in rooms on 2 small levels. Not worth $20. And because of the size, I had to wait in line for entry to the museum, then waited on a second line to get a bite at Café Sabarsky (the fare was fine, but the room was far less atmospheric than I was anticipating\/hoping), and then lastly, a third line to use the restroom. I was fed up at that point, it's fairly obvious that the restroom facilities are way too small for the establishment. Going through the exhibit took less time than all the queueing.\n\nAlso, I must mention that the museum has many ridiculous policies that I witnessed certain staff members very rudely enforcing. For instance, an employee accosted a woman and asked in what could have been interpreted as a hostile tone, \"Miss, are you here with somebody?\" The woman was clearly taken aback. The employee then informed her that visitors are only allowed to bring in one bag and she was carrying two. It turns out she was there with her husband who had gone off to the restroom and so she was carrying his bag in addition to hers. Not sure how the guard made her resolve the issue. And because of the rain, of course all umbrellas had to be checked in. However, they said coats did not. But then, an elderly man was approached and told he had to check his coat in. Turns out, trenches and other water-repellent outerwear does have to be checked in. There is a security guard in practically every room and some have poor manners in the way they handle the enforcement of all the policies (which should just be clearly displayed somewhere prior to entry). One female guard was rather belligerent and practically screaming, \"It's the policy! Is it my fault?\" to a woman (not sure what her crime was). One of her colleagues intervened to calm her down. Very unprofessional and lending a very inhospitable air to the place.\n\nUnless there's an exhibit you feel you absolutely must see, I would skip the Neue Galerie."},{"review":"Short of having to fly across the Atlantic Ocean and land in Vienna,Austria,it is possible to get a taste what life looked and felt back in Vienna at the beginning of the XX Century.\nThe impressive ,Old World building and its magnificent marble staircase puts one immediately in the mood of being transported back to the Emperor's and J .Strauss's times.No waltzing in the grand rooms ,though. \nThere is always an interesting exhibit plus the permanent collection of Art Deco\nartifacts.\nNo visit to this great place is complete without standing in front of and admiring the beauty of Klimt's portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer also known as \"The Woman in Gold\".\nAfterwards, finish your tour by seating in the dark-wood paneled walls of the cafe and enjoy the most delightful Viennese pastries without feeling guilty of the calories ingested.\nAuf viedersen"},{"review":"Breathtaking \"Woman in gold\" but otherwise a little disappointing because the other paintings on display are not of the same standard."},{"review":"although there are other paintings and decorative arts objects that are interesting, the Adele Bloch-Bauer painting by Klimt is the star.

The play chronicled the troubled life of the great Billie Holiday and was set in a London theater. \n\nFor those who don't know Dee Dee Bridgewater, they know her now. She was phenomenal, signing some of the great songs to include \"Lady Sings the Blues\", \"Good Morning Heartache\", and \"A Foggy Day in London Town\". She also sang some of those that may don't be as well known to others. I loved the rendition of \"T'ain't Nobody's Bizness\" and \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\". The musicians that accompany her were great!\n\nThe play is a great celebration and tribute to the great Billie Holiday.\n\nI recommend the play without reservation.

Her acting out events of Holiday's life were very well done."},{"review":"I've never been so disappointed by a show that thoroughly delighted my kids. \n\nMake no mistake. They loved it. In fact, anybody under 16 who's read the books and can't get enough Harry Potter will likely be completely delighted by this show.\n\nOn the other hand, older theatergoers who understand the possibilities of live theater will likely find themselves, like I did, frustrated by the opportunity lost. Potted Potter could have been great farce like the sort of thing being done by the Reduced Shakespeare Company. Instead it's just a funny little two-person street show that's been stretched out to 75 minutes in order to justify the Broadway location and ticket prices. \n\nMore power to them. Dan Clarkson and Jeff Turner are certainly likable and even talented entertainers. In fact, in 2005, they created a street show about Harry Potter to perform for people waiting in line for the release of the sixth book in the series. A year later, they stretched the concept out to create what ultimately became the Potted Potter stage show. \n\nThe cheesy running gag (and convenient conceit) of the show is that it was supposed to be a big extravaganza, with a big cast and bigger sets; but Dan has never read the books, and squandered the production money on an awesome dragon set piece to be revealed later. The dragon is, of course, destined to disappoint when it finally appears after a lengthy delayed reveal.\n\nIn the meantime, the two actors parade about a mostly empty stage, using J.K. Rowling's seven books as a vehicle to lightly tie together a series of gags, many of which have nothing to do with Harry Potter. \n\nHouse lights go up. House lights go down. Beach balls are tossed into the audience. Children are brought on stage. Pratfalls and juvenile humor get the crowd involved and give the two performers plenty of opportunities to ad lib, a great formula for making each night's audience feel special.\n\nIf all that sounds great to you, then by all means go for it. You'll have fun, and the show will be over in time for dinner. Just don't expect anything more."},{"review":"After spending two weeks in Disney \/ Universal Orlando we never expected a last minute tkts purchase to provide the highlight of our three week holiday.

We were 8 people (4 children, ages 5,9,9,11) and we are in our late 30s-40s. Most of our group were die-hard Potter fans. The theater was a comfortable temperature and one of the stars of the show went around shaking hands with the audience prior to the show starting...nice touch. Once the show began it was simply disappointing. No set, bumbling humor that one would see in a camp skit. Truly not worthy of our time. The concept is excellent but needs to be way more than it was.

Hang near the guard and he \"may\" ask if any one is waiting to get in for the next tour. Then you can get in no matter how little you have been waiting. Also note that somehow taxi drivers say they can't stop in front of the UN and honestly, they don't know where to find the entrance. But there are no \"No Stopping\" signs. Of course, no standing or parking. Aim for 1st Ave and 46th Street. Try to follow the line of people drifting in one direction since there is an amazing lack of signs directing you to the starting point of the tour.

Peter Gallagher is also wonderful as are the four porters (singing\/tap-dancers) who wow the audience with their show-stopping numbers.\n\nIn three words -- GO SEE IT!!"},{"review":"Let me clarify at the start that I'm rating my experience with the box office\/customer service and not the show that I saw nor the charm of the venue itself. Just to fill you in -- I saw Cabaret twice, with two different female leads. Emma Stone was fair -- not awful, but certainly not memorable. The other female lead I viewed was Sienna Miller, who in my estimation, did a far better job than Ms. Stone. Alan Cumming was absolutely terrific, and the production itself was mesmerizing.\n\nNow, to the venue. I love the theatre itself. It's definitely charming. The first time I saw the show, I intentionally got a lesser expensive ticket and was in the rear part of the mezzanine. My expectations of the seat itself were low, but it was actually fine -- good visibility, etc. considering the distance from the stage. The second time I went back, I took a friend who was interested in seeing Cabaret, and my intention was to get really good seats. I had a choice between a side table right next to the stage, and seats in the front row of the front section of the mezzanine (both almost equally expensive). My instincts were to get the table by the stage, but I couldn't quite remember if they were partial view tables, thus I called twice (not once) to get guidance from the appropriate theatre staff. Each time, I was given the same misinformation. Here's a bit of what I was told: if you sit at a side table by the stage, you'll spend much of the time looking at people's backs; the front of the mezzanine hangs WAY OVER the downstairs tables, and you'll feel very close to the stage; one of the best views in the entire theatre is from the front of the mezzanine, etc. (you get the idea). \n\nComplete garbage, and both my friend and I were REALLY angry! Let me state quite clearly to all potential ticket buyers that the front part of the mezzanine has MANY disadvantages. First of all, it is NOT close to the stage -- not even remotely. I felt almost as far from the stage there as I did in my prior seat. Second, there's NO legroom. My friend and I are both short, and we were both uncomfortable. We actually tried to prop our feet on the wall in front of us, and an usher told us that was forbidden! REALLY? What harm were we doing? Worst of all, there's a big BAR extending across that area. Unless we consistently leaned far forward (not a particularly comfortable position to maintain for an extended period), an entire section of the stage was obscured from our line of vision (by the bar).\n\nI kept looking down at the table at which I was going to purchase tickets. Of course, those audience members were so close to the performers that they were probably getting sprayed by sweat! As well (and most logically), the actors were performing all over the stage. The views from that area must have been phenomenal. I did stroll through the downstairs area during a break, and that only confirmed my conclusions.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how supposedly knowledgeable staff could have so misguided me and my friend, and got us to pay a fortune for seats where our legs were cramped, our vision was blocked by an iron bar, and we were, in reality, quite distant from the action. It didn't completely ruin our experience of the show, but it definitely had a very negative impact, particularly given how much money we spent -- not just on the show, but on getting to NYC, staying overnight, etc.\n\nI'd certainly go to Studio 54 again, but I absolutely won't rely on their staff for knowledgeable advice."},{"review":"What a great family show .

I think the market only opens on Sundays."},{"review":"We've been to New York City several times in the past three years since our daughter moved there, but this is only the second flea market we've visited. The first was Hester Street, a very small and limited space which was a disappointment. I wanted to go to Williamsburg for the Brooklyn Flea, but that happens on Sundays and we were leaving after breakfast on Sunday. So, our daughter navigated us to the Greenflea and I was SO looking forward to it! There is a nice selection of merchandise. Lots of vintage clothing and some recent fashions, mostly gently worn and not too over priced, if you consider what you'd pay in a retail shop. There was a great selection of costume jewelry. I got a gold tone necklace with Isis, Egyptian goddess of magic and life for $8, haggled down from $10 because the clasp is very unstable. I scored two small Fiestaware cream soup bowls which I'd been hunting for years for $12 each, haggled down from $15. There was a third, but it had some damage. There was a little oil painting of two lemons on a black background in a very cool frame, but the sticker said $48 and the vendor insisted on no less than $40. I offered her $30 and she flatly refused. I know there's a difference between life in Pittsburgh, PA and life in NYC, but I own two nice little oil paintings, one of flowers and one of fruit, which are similar to the painting she had for sale. I paid $5 for one and $10 for the other. So, I was not about to pay $40 for this one. A flea market is still a flea market. However, I did cave on a blue and white rhinestone collar necklace for our daughter. The vendor was asking $28 and he would only come down to $25. He seemed offended when I offered $23. She really wanted it, and she was a real sport dragging her old parents around for the weekend, so I treated her. There was also some furniture, some rugs, some original jewelry, posters, postcards, sunglasses, etc. All sorts of misc. We ate our lunch there too. There was an impressive selection of local caterers and restaurants offering tempting dumplings, pulled pork sandwiches, Indian food, etc. We chose made to order spinach paneer filled doshas, my husband had lassi and our daughter and I had cucumber\/lemon aide. We sat on the steps of a school at one end of the parking lot. The food was very good, the lemon aide was a little to spicy and cucumbery for my taste. We used the port-a-potties on the sidewalk outside the fence before we took the metro to our schooner tour of New York Harbor. We were glad for the convenience of the port-a-potties, but seriously, bring a clothes pin for your nose. Next time we visit NY, I hope we will find another flea market with equally interesting merchandise and vendors who are more agreeable to haggling. After all, it is a flea market, not a boutique."},{"review":"I am glad I went. For starters there was good food upon entering from north entrance. Overall good variety and quality with a nice combo of cheap, medium and expensive items. Also in the Summer there may just be a small farmers market across the street in back of the museum of natural history."},{"review":"I had a great time walking around this flea market and looking at all the wares.

Some old some new - and something different from a Macy's! Meant for locals as well as tourists, food stalls as well. Noticed the pre-loved fur coats were not selling to fast! Red fox looks lovely, but just not PC these days, same goes for the mink... as they say, hold onto a fashion item for long enough and it will come back into fashion one day... this could be an exception. Anyway, great for a browse, and you never know, you could find some treasure!"},{"review":"Being a religious treasure and bargain hunter I found this flea market as all the rest of similar second hand places the hit and miss spot.\n It was always complex kind of experience for me, joined with neighborhood shopping and topping with lunch at different local restaurants.\nAt the Greenflea I have found a set of three Arabic crystal lamps for my house in Italy. Absolutely beautiful and one of a kind exotic design. Among other hunted items one Sunday I took home a fabulous mink coat for just 200 $.\nWhat can I say ? It is a destination filled with intrigued unknown and surprises."},{"review":"This Flea Market is one of the best i have ever been to.

The photographs give Picasso's work and life a new context. It is wonderful seeing the real photos of his life and work juxtaposed so you may get a sense of how he thought and how he approached the work. One work in particular was a photo of an octopus which he used as inspiration for one of his paintings of one of his women on the beach, looking very much like the octopus. You got such a clear sense of his life and circle of friends. Fantastic and must see."},{"review":"Sometimes people get intimidated by entering an art gallery: well, Gagosian in NY is the closest thing to a museum but without the massive crowd.

But when I viewed his new work at the Gagosian my only thought that he is running out of good ideas. The paintings featuring classical sculpture were unappealing and the self-imposed graffiti did not help. The new sculptures based on balloon art looked like poor works done by copycats of his famous rabbit. There were plenty of guards in the gallery, but they needn't worry--I wouldn't have any of the pieces in my home even if they were free."},{"review":"If you are into contemporary art, skip high admissions and crowds at museums and go to Gagosian instead.

It was deceiving when we were there that it seemed as if the third floor were only offices but in fact there is additional exhibition space up on that floor so be sure to continue up to the third floor.

Dyckman House is off the beaten path but easy to reach via either the \"A\" or \"1\" trains. Visit and learn about the interesting family history.

A building that traces it's origins to a Dutchman who came to the Americas in 1660. The farmhouse was built later in the 1700's by his descendants who owned 250 acres of Manhattan at one time. I have no idea if any of that prime real estate is in the possession of current descendants...but what a legacy!\nIt was very cool to be in that old farmhouse which has been restored to it's original plan. Just surreal to stand on the farmhouse steps and watch the buses and cars on the street...over a hundred years ago there were horses and carriages on the very same street.\nSome of the exhibits I found interesting were Delft tiles dating back to the era.The family kitchen in the basement and the small bedrooms were also interesting. \nThe farmhouse is very well connected by subway as the whole round trip was under $6. The place is only open weekends...check their website. The farmhouse is a shorter walk if you get off at the 207th st station instead of the Dyckman st station. There is food and coffee closeby."},{"review":"The Dyckman Farmhouse is the last remaining 18th century farmhouse in Manhattan. It's located in Inwood, Manhattan's northernmost neighborhood. The house is lovingly preserved, & shows what much of Manhattan once was like. It is a long subway ride, or an even longer bus ride, from anywhere in Manhattan, but very worthwhile. (Best of all is to walk everywhere in Manhattan, even here!) The entry fee is next to nothing."},{"review":"The Dyckman Farmhouse is in Inwood (at the top of Manhattan Is.) - a little out of the way, but if you are up this way, stop in. The story of the Dyckman family is interesting. Amazing to think that a home this old still survives. Some kitchen artifacts that are amazing. Gardens are taken care of by volunteers."},{"review":"I stumbled across this museum on my way to the nearby park, and was surprised such a place even existed. It is a well-preserved farmhouse from the eighteenth century, with wide floorbeams and a garden and well out back. The maps on display in the front room tell the story of a now-vanished rural Manhattan, and the genealogical display introduces you to the families who owned the house. You can even visit the basement and see the bedrock on which the house is built. It gave me a feeling of peace to be transported back to this quieter time. A unique feature of the museum is that the upstairs is decorated and furnished not as we now envision an eighteenth-century farmhouse with our current breadth of knowledge, but as the museum's founders envisioned it at the turn of the twentieth century: an unrealistically pampered, genteel, even Victorian idealization of the time period. This interesting curatorial choice is very rare to see, and lends a historiological meta-museum aspect to your visit that you may not get anywhere else."},{"review":"This Dutch farmhouse is a jewel in New York City history. The farmhouse was originally built in 1784 and reflect that period. There are at least seven rooms that are well worth the visit especially the main parlor, kitchen (cellar level), two bedrooms, and the museum artifact room. Be prepared to walk stairs and keep low as the ceilings are low in certain spots. The staff is well prepared to answer your questions and my only negative criticism is that admission is $1. per person which is too little considering what the upkeep of this farmhouse is. They do accept additional donations if you feel inclined as I did. Dyckman Farmhouse is open Friday-Sunday 11am-5pm currently. In the warmer weather add additional time to stop and sit in the spacious garden out back."},{"review":"Having travelled up the A Line to visit The Cloisters, we were checking on TripAdvisor for other nearby attractions and discovered the Dyckman. The museum provides a fascinating look backwards to an earlier, and simpler, era. Well presented, with a wealth of detail and reminders of a life style now gone. After a visit to The Cloisters, and walk down the Main Street with excellent options for lunch, the Dyckman provided a good balance for a day at the top end of the A Line, the final station at 207th is nearby.

I had never heard of this place, just happened by and went in for a tour. It's hard to believe this picturesque historic spot is really there! But it is, and it is a fascinating place. It functioned for a time as a day hotel, a place where New Yorkers could spend a day in what was then countryside - having a meal, socializing, etc. in lovely surroundings. The tour was very interesting and this place is a hidden gem - hopefully more and more people will learn about it and visit."},{"review":"We second the comments of the other visitors who found this to be a gem. The Colonial Dames of America have done an excellent job of providing a sense of what a significant carriage house of the early 1800's was like. The table was laid out with (models of) turtle soup, fruits, vegetables. The kitchen looked almost as though it was in service. Upstairs, the guest rooms were sparse, but conveyed a sense of accommodations. The bar was a wonder. Natalia and Susan provided a great tour."},{"review":"Who would've thought this was located in the middle of Manhattan?! Located under the Ed Koch (Queensboro or 59th St.) Bridge, the Mount Vernon operated as a day hotel from 1826 to 1833, where people would come to socialize and eat for the day. Located 4 miles from City Hall, New Yorkers would come by stagecoach or ferry to 61st Street to spend a day in the country. Interesting, the street grid was already laid out in the early 1800's. The tour involves a film, which gives you a taste of what life was like at that time, and a guided tour of the rooms and garden. The docent was very knowledgeable.

What would 23 1\/2 acres in Manhattan cost you today? Our docent, Patricia, was very friendly and knowledgeable. It's a Quaker style old stone building in the country. NYC went from downtown to 14 Street and people came up for the day by boat or carriage. The men had drinks at the bar while the ladies talked upstairs. There was a stream nearby that provided water. I would recommend it highly."},{"review":"Here are 3 places (see also Merchant's House Museum and The Louis Armstrong House Museum) that none of my New York friends have ever heard of, & all were really worth the trip. The Abigail Adams Smith house, now called the Mount Vernon Hotel, is an early 1800\u2019s place in the midst of mid-town. Try to imagine none of the massive buildings around it and only countryside. There wasn't much in the way of furnishings but the gardens were very nice."},{"review":"Great museum stop for families or adults. A beautiful garden in the heart of the east side.

We were on our way (via a southbound bus) to the Roosevelt Island Tram and by happenstance walked past the museum. Glad we did.\n\nI wish we had asked the name of the knowledgeable & enthusiastic house guide - she deserves a shout-out. \n\nIt's had to imagine NYC with dirt roads & forested bluffs - but the MVHM takes you back to a time when life was slower & a day in the \"country\" was only a buggy or boat ride away from the hustle & bustle of life on the southern tip of Manhattan. Music, food, sport & drink - all from the perspective of early Nineteenth Century visitors.\n\nWe really enjoyed our visit!"},{"review":"The Mount Vernon Hotel Museum was built in 1799 as a carriage house, and converted into a hotel in the 1820\u2019s. Nestled on a piece of property once owned by John Adams\u2019 daughter, Abigail Adams Smith, the hotel is on E. 61st Street near the East River. This area was once four miles north of the city and considered the countryside. \n\nIn the early days of the hotel, a stage would come up from NYC and leave you for just the day. Apparently the proprietors preferred day travelers to overnight ones, as the day travelers' business was more lucrative. You could fish from the pier down the street, watch horseracing from the windows on the second floor, play cards, read the newspapers (quite expensive in those days), play cribbage or sew, or just have a healthy repast with fresh water, ale or lemonade. It was a lovely rural escape from the din, dirt and crowds South of 14th Street.\n\nDenise was our tour guide and showed us the beautiful (if to some people unpalatable) hair jewelry exhibit. We watched the informative video on the history of the hotel, and then Denise took us around the grounds for a good two hours. She knew so much about the house, its furniture and furnishings, many owners and even children who grew up there, that you could almost feel what it was like back then. If you have visited any of the historic old buildings in Boston or Virginia, you'll recognize the wonderful smell of the old wooden floors and furniture. A beautiful portrait of James Stuart, a Scottish diarist who recorded his experiences at the hotel, hangs prominently on the second floor, borrowed (I believe) from the National Gallery of Scotland. Mr. Stuart's accounts of his visit at the Mount Vernon Hotel are incorporated into the video, and Denise told us even more. It was completely wonderful.\n\nSo few places in New York City have an atmosphere in which one can experience living history from over 100 years (or almost 200 years) ago. The Mount Vernon Hotel and Museum is one of that handful of places. At $8 admission (adults, less for children and seniors), how can you go wrong?\n\nA cute little gift shop with books (including a volume of Mr. Stuart's diary in which his time at the Hotel is recorded), quill pens, antique-style games like marbles and \"pick up sticks,\" and $4 sachets of real dried lavender completes your visit."}]},{"nearBy":["Roosevelt Island Aerial Tram","Bloomingdale's","Queensboro Bridge"]}]},{"CaywoodVineyards.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"9666 Route 414","postalCode":"14860","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 607-582-7230"},{"Recommended length of visit":" <1 hour"},{"reviews":[{"review":"We're very excited to see that Caywood is finally following suit and building a deck on their winery.

This is a great little counter location in the Chelsea Market. I purchased two items and I wish I had bought one of everything.

The dark chocolate is a perfect blend to compliment the sweet and crunch center of the honeycomb. Very well done. I also purchased a Fig and Ricotta caramel. It's so good that it is hard to describe. The fig is very prominent but only on the back end. It gets stronger as you chew it and plays well of the mild sweetness of the caramel. A truly amazing bite!"},{"review":"So I'm headed toward the Chelsea Market, looking for edible souvenirs of New York City to take back to my friends and, thanks to the power of the internet, I learned about a relatively new shop inside called Liddabit Sweets. Specifically, I learn about Liddabit Sweets' beer pretzel caramels which happen to be made with two types of ale from Brooklyn Brewery. \n\nSince I'm all about the alcohol, I wended my into the bowels of the Market to find this little sliver of a candy store filled with tantalizing displays of wee treats and glass jars with individually wrapped goodies inside. Very expensive goodies.\n\nI figured I'd take one for the team and purchased a beer pretzel caramel to sample. That was two dollars ($1.84 plus tax) for a piece about double the size of a Brach's caramel. But forget about that, and never again shall the word Brach's be in the same sentence as Liddabit Sweets. Because corn syrup and soybean oil can never reach the heights of richness as does dairy farm heavy cream and butter. That candy just about sent me over the moon. Sinfully smooth sweet buttery caramel wrapped around a crunchy (but not too crunchy) salty (but not too salty) beery pretzel. Yum.\n\nI bought two $9 half-dozen boxes. Because such goodness needs to be shared and more people need to know that a place called Liddabit Sweets exists. The cost may be a bit difficult to swallow [hence the docking of a dot], but Liddabit's sweets are not. Indulge."},{"review":"Dentro do Chelsea Market. O lugar é bonitinho.

The historic theater was built in 1927. I was expecting to sit in an uncomfortable seat with my knees pressed against the seat in front of me. Surprisingly, the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room. However, getting to that comfortable seat wasn\u2019t easy\u2026. \n\nAt the end of September I got tickets at The Late Show\u2019s website for Friday, October 30, 2015. My husband and I arrived at the theater at 1pm to join the reservation line of about 25 people. There was a second line of about 15 people waiting for stand-by tickets. Around 2:15pm or so, several staffers came out, checked our reservations and ID, stamped our hands, gave us numbered tickets (I was number 43) and told us to return at 3:30pm. We returned, showed our tickets, went through security, and waited 90 minutes in the lobby before entering the theater! Finally seated, I was in the third row, center. The warm up comic was Paul Mecurio (I\u2019ve seen him before, when he was the warm up comic for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart) and as usual, he was funny.\n\nThe show was terrific! It was the day before Halloween, and to see Stephen Colbert walk on stage dressed as a vampire, complete with fangs, made me forget I had been waiting in an overcrowded, stuffy lobby for 90 minutes. Would I do it again? Yes.\n\nMore comments: 1) Jon Batiste & Stay Human, along with the guest band the Zombies played complete songs during the commercial breaks. It was like being at a concert! 2) The theater was cold. If you\u2019re sensitive to cold, bring a sweater or scarf, or both. 3) It was possible to use the toilets before the show started and during the breaks. When the show ended, the restroom near the lobby had an \u201Cout of order\u201D sign on it. Too much of an inconvenience for the staff to let people use the restroom? 4) Your Late Show experience will likely differ, but you will be entertained!"},{"review":"Went to a live taping of Late Show with Stephen Colbert last Friday night. We had ordered tickets online way back on September when they were released on his website. The \"tickets\" we received back then came with a note that said all shows are overbooked to ensure capacity and no one is guaranteed entry. Told us to get in line on the day of the show no later than 3. We were nervous about the no guaranteed admittance so we got there around 2-215 and waited. As long as you are there by 3 I think with a confirmation email you should get in. Shortly before 3 they checked our id's and our confirmation and gave us tickets -(I got #168 )and told us to come back at 330 and stand in line in the order of our tickets numbers (and to make sure we didn't come early as there is not a lot of room around sidewalk and to make sure we had been to the bathroom). Others were told to come at 4 or 430. Then they start letting us in. This is the part I wish could be improved as it kind of sucked the excitement out of the crowd. You have to pass thru security and then we were crammed into the lobby in a long winding line. It seemed like an eternity waiting in the cramped space. Then right around 5 a staff member came out and talked about clapping loud, laughing and having a good time. Then you go to your seats . We ended up in around the 4th row. Our seats were very good and quite close to the stage. Then a comedian comes on to warm up the crowd . He is quite funny and he brings people from the audience up on stage and jokes with them. Then Stephen does some Q and A which was fun. Then Jon Batiste and his band Stay Human come out and play (They were excellent). They had Vance Joy sit in with the band for the night and I love him so that was a bonus. Then the show starts. Its fun to see how things go on during a taping. We finished up shortly after 7. All in all it was a great experience and I will do again. Only hitch was the waiting in the lobby for so long."},{"review":"First it was Ed Sullivan, and who was more famous than he?

No cover charge and reasonably priced. Would recommend this place"},{"review":"Great for history buffs. Easy to find during your walk in central park great for all ages. Can't believe it is such a old piece of history"},{"review":"Tucked behind the Met, Cleopatra's Needle is a bit of world history that is easily accessible for viewing. I'm always amazed at the grandeur and historical significance of historical artifacts such as this. \n\nWhen I first visited in Summer 2014, I was so disappointed that it was not accessible due to cleaning. But on our 2015 trip, I was so excited to see that it was available for close viewing. \n\nI would recommend it for anyone who enjoys items that have been around (outside and uncovered) for thousands of years."},{"review":"There is stands, behind the Metropolitan Art Museum, just off 5th Ave. It was a gift from Egypt in the late 19th century. Two exist (to my knowledge) one is still in the Middle East and this one in Central Park. The one that was left in place is said to be still in fine shape and the symbols are still sharp. In Central Park, a century and a half have of humidity and pollution have taken it's toll. But, still well worth seeing."},{"review":"We got to see Cleopatra's Needle in Central Park. Not far from the 5th Ave. entrance. It is one of 3 needles. This needle of given from Egypt and then they gave a needle that sits on the shores of the Thames River in London and 1 needle is in Paris."},{"review":"The Obelisk \"Cleopatra's Needle\" situated just behind the MET in Central Park is certainly one to visit if you have an interest in Egyptology, architecture or history. The 70ft tall, 200 tonne weighing 3500 year old Obelisk was gifted to the city in 1869 of which the twin resides on south bank London.\n\nIt is mesmerising to stand in front of and try to imagine the hard work that went in to creating, this 3500 years ago, let alone the task of getting it from Egypt to New York but it certainly adds a little diversity to the park.\n\nVisited in April and there was no renovation \/ scaffolding works so that is all clear."},{"review":"One of the interesting things you can see in Central Park is the often overlooked obelisk called Cleopatra's Needle. This is a 70 foot tall structure, weighing over 200 tonnes that was built 3,500 years ago in Egypt, yet now calling NYC's Central Park its home. \n\nCleopatra's Needle was gifted to the city of New York in 1869 as a showing of friendship between the America and Egypt. The obelisk is a twin, its sibling structure having been gifted to the city of London in 1818 and now situated along the banks of the River Thames. \n\nThe structure is not in the best of condition these days, having suffered quite a bit of deterioration over the centuries, much the result of having rested in the sands of Egypt for over 500 years after the at Alexandria. Regardless, it is a genuine heritage and historical treasure that can be openly viewed in Central Park. Further, being located just behind the MET, it makes a convenient place to visit after spending time in the museum, an ideal complement to MET's Egypt rooms and historic Egyptian Temple of Dendur housed there. \n\nUnfortunately, during our last visit, we discovered that Cleopatra's Needle was under restoration, with the the terrace having been gated and covered over, preventing close access to the obelisk. The good news is that the scaffolding which was around the structure earlier in the year had been removed, which means you can still observe the structure from a short distance away. Conservation notices suggested the restoration was to be finished by autumn 2014 but that was clearly not the case as it remained much under wraps during Xmas week. \n\nIn the end, Cleopatra's Needle can be a nice thing to see if you have interest in Egyptology, ancient landmarks, history or are simply wanting to see something unique during your time in Central Park. Hopefully the remaining restoration efforts will be finished by the time of your visit."},{"review":"The needle is tucked away in Central Park. It's so old, but very interesting.

The campus dates to the late 19th Century\/early 20th Century, designed by McKim Meade and White in a Beaux Arts style. Because most of the campus was laid out and designed at one time, it's a bit like an architectural museum of the period. Not too many tourists venture up to the Columbia Campus, meaning that it's not too terribly busy. There are green lawns, sculpture (a casting of Rodin's The Thinker, for example) and large open spaces. Quite a departure from Times Square\u2014or even Central Park on the weekend, which is often mobbed with people. There's a lot of history here\u2014among the notable students who have attended the university are Alexander Hamilton and John Jay (although, not at this location). The infamous Manhattan Project that developed the Atom Bomb during the 1940s started on this campus. And the Pulitzer Prize is administered here. Columbia College, the undergraduate school, is known for its core curriculum in which students read the \"great books,\" mostly from the Western cannon. Its graduate schools include top 10 law, business and medical schools and strong programs in architecture, social studies and the humanities. The neighborhood, Morningside Heights, contains quite a few restaurants and delis catering to the student lifestyle. A pleasant walk from the campus one block West of Broadway up Claremont Avenue to 120th Street will lead you past Barnard College, the Union Theological Seminary and the interdenominational Riverside Church, designed in a Neo-Gothic style. Another block West and one a few blocks North (122nd Street), will lead you to Grant's Tomb, at one time one of New York's top tourist attractions."},{"review":"Great Campus houses a lot of departments and it is great for people who are part of it as teachers, students and staff.

As far as I could read, it should be a not turistic place for gospel functions and one of the most emotioning. But the name itself says in advance what this place is about. It is not a church, so you will not attend a mess, with a priest, lectures and sermons enriched with Gospel songs (what I hoped to assist to). It is, for real, an assembly of local harlem citizens who spend 2 hours of their Sunday's praying singing a lot of songs. Really, they are not songs, since have no lyrics apart for one or two lines that are repeated in loop for 10 minutes. At first, it is very emotioning and funny, but after two songs your wish will be to leave the assembly (what I did after the first hour and with me many other tourists). Finally, it is not true it is a not turistic place, since dozens of international people are allowed to assist to the function and put on the upper floor of the building.

It also has a beautiful great rose window and dramatic Moorish stone arches that keep the architecture as a sharp contrast to most other religious structures in the city.\n\nThe building was restored by 2001 in the original style after an accidental fire in August 1998.

Una experiencia lamentable. \nTodas las guías anuncian que el oficio es a las 11h, y recomiendan que se llegue con bastante antelación. Así lo hicimos hecho: llegamos 45 minutos antes. Había una cierta cola, y esperamos bajo la lluvia, porque el domingo llovía. Un señor en la puerta iba dando entrada a las personas que teníamos delante, de manera escalonada. Cuando llegamos a la puerta, y por lo tanto cuando ya nos tocaba, eran las 11h en punto. En ese momento, el señor nos anunció a todos los que estábamos fuera que la parte cantada de la misa había terminado! Absolutamente impresentable. Llevábamos 45 minutos bajo la lluvia, y este señor fue incapaz de avisarnos antes. A la vez que nos anunciaba eso, nos dijo que a partir de ese momento tocaba la predicación del sacerdote, y que duraría hasta las 11:30h. Como ya no teníamos tiempo de ir a otra iglesia, decidimos entrar. Todavía peor. En primer lugar, ante nuestra sorpresa seguían cantando. Y la verdad, de manera absolutamente lamentable en lo que a calidad musical se refiere, con un acompañamiento electrónico de pésima calidad y dolorosamente ensordecedor. A los diez minutos el \"coro\" se retiró y empezó a hablar el sacerdote. Y lo hizo no hasta las 11:30h, sino hasta bien pasadas las 12h. Y todo ello, con un calor sofocante.\nEn todas las guías se pide a los turistas respeto. Y estoy absolutamente de acuerdo. Pero el personal de esta iglesia debería también tener respeto por las personas que de buena fe y de manera respetuosa se desplazan hasta ahí dedicando una parte de su escaso tiempo en NY para conocer de cerca su forma de vivir la fe.

Es increíble el clima de respeto, todo ese entorno de espiritualidad que se vivencia en la misa gospel, las canciones, su energía, sus voces maravillosas. \nNo cobran entrada, solo reparten sobres donde podrán aportar una colaboración.\nAconsejo llegar temprano porque dejan ingresar a un cupo determinado de turistas.

He is regarded as one of the most famous kings in Poland and Lithuania and is credited with unifying the two countries in a turbulent Middle Age period in central Europe. \n\nThe bronze equestrian monument is of Jagiello in battle attire, with swords in both hands, lifted and crossed, symbolising unity of the Polish and Lithuanian forces or perhaps victory over the Teutonic Order at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410. \n\nIn the end, the King Jagiello monument is an interesting thing to find, particularly if you enjoy European history. It is also well located in the Mid Park area at 79th street where there are other interesting things to see and enjoy.

The wait for the line isn't that bad.\nThere's an option to buy a photo and purchase headphones with a recorded walk-through. You can also pay extra to go up to higher floors. Not many people do this so if you want to avoid the crowds then this is a good option. Otherwise the view is basically the same. \nIf able, make sure you go during the day AND at night. The experiences are very different and both are equally amazing.\nBe prepared for lots and lots of wind! If you are wearing a skirt it might get blown upwards.

I walked into \"Hand to God\" with pretty low expectations - having received free tickets from a friend was my incentive for attending. I held the notion that a play based on a puppet could not hold my attention for very long - boy was I wrong! I am so happy I went! The story line ranged from poking fun of the structure and stereotypes of church culture, to addressing serious psychological issues related to death and loss, to inappropriate sexual relations, to blood and gore. So unpredictable - which I love! I was laughing pretty much straight through. Please note, that in order to truly enjoy this wonderful performance, you really need to enter into the experience with an open mind and the ability to laugh at religion-targeted humor. If you are not able to do this, it could be taken as highly offensive. The theater is also quite small and makes for an appreciated and more intimate viewing experience. I would highly recommend this play, but only to a certain crowd as not all will find it as humorous as I."},{"review":"My husband & I wanted to see a Broadway show & as soon as I saw the flyer for \"Hand to God\" I knew I had to see it...it had puppets ;)\n\nThe play did not let me down. It was jaw-droppingly funny with really great acting. It was amazing how quickly you saw the puppet as its own individual character rather than a sock on the end of Steven Boyer's arm (or maybe it was just me!).\n\nAlthough it played for laughs there was quite a deep; thought-provoking message throughout which has stuck in my mind ever since.\n\nI would definitely recommend this show ... but for adults not children."},{"review":"We saw Elephant Man at this intimate theater.

How he can remember his lines as well as his foul mouthed hand is amazing. Loved the show. Definitely recommend."},{"review":"We laughed our way through most of the show despite the fact that it's a disturbing story of a mother & son reeling from the unexpected death of their unhappy patriarch & the way others use that loss to get closer to them.\n\nThe acting from all five actors was superb, especially Geneva Carr as the mother. We were initially disappointed to discover that Alex Mandell was subbing for Steven Boyer as the son for our performance. No worries! Alex was amazing. Hard to imagine someone better in the role. The sex scene between the puppets was a spot-on send up of lousy sex that had knowing women laughing louder than the men.\n\nWe had very religious born-again Christians in our group who weren't offended, but there's plenty to take offense at if you're so inclined. \n\nI highly recommend this Robert Askins play--its inventive, clever & poignant."},{"review":"Small theatre. Sat on the aisle row 7 - great seat. A teen boy w\/his evil, foul mouthed puppet alongw\/his crazy mother dominate the show. This show is not for the prudish. If you are OK w\/the F word being thrown around up and down and sideways then you are good to go! Funny sex scene 1st act and hilarious sex scene second act. Well done but not super extraordinary. Only 5 actors in the show. I got 2 for 1 tickets so was happy w\/cost of seeing this show.

I saw Hand to God at this Theater and I loved it. I think the show is a must-see when you go visit NYC. I sat in the last row of the center mezzanine and the vantage point is still great. Audio was great. I was a little distracted by sound booth on the right box section but the show was beautiful that my attention was fully directed towards the show. There's no obstruction and seats are designed like stadium seating. For small theaters, I would recommend seating at the mezzanine because the elevation of the orchestra are bad and if you are unlucky, all you see is head through out the show."},{"review":"Had the opportunity on this trip see Hand of God. Probably not for those of faith and the moral majority but we sure loved it! Well acted and very entertaining. I highly recommend it to our friends that take religion these days with a grain of salt."},{"review":"A boy\u2019s despondency over his father\u2019s untimely death forms the catalyst for the new offbeat and raucous Broadway play, Hands to God. Jason (Steven Boyer) has almost shut down over the anguish he feels. The world is suffocating him. He doesn\u2019t communicate well with his mother Margery (Geneva Carr) who, as a way to cope with her grief, has started a puppet workshop at the local church run by Pastor Greg (Marc Kudisch). Two other adolescents populate the class. Timothy (Michael Oberholtzer), a slacker who has more then a puppy love passion for Margery; and Jessica (Sarah Stiles), a reticent, but assured young woman. Within this stifling tension Jason\u2019s hand puppet, Tyrone, suddenly acquires a mind of its own, a mind both nefarious and outrageous, which proves toxic for all involved. \n\nPlaywright Robert Askins has written a truly original play that at its core is an examination of a young man\u2019s descent and, finally ascent, from a personal hell. He has crafted Tyrone to become an extension and conduit of all the hurt and pain Jason feels. While the puppet is devilish, it is not possessed of anything greater then a youth\u2019s demonstrative cries for help. Askins has produced a lot of funny moments in the show, but Hand in God is more a sober affair.\n\nSteven Boyer is superb. He expressively conveys the angst and inner turmoil of Jason. I\u2019m sure many teenagers viewing this character would nod their head silently and knowingly. But his portrayal of the hurting young man is only half of his outstanding performance. During most of the show he is also the life essence of the demonic, foul-mouthed hand puppet Tyrone. This is no simple sock puppet, but one manipulated with two rods. Boyer transforms this inanimate being into a fully fleshed out part of the ensemble. Many times during the play the two\u2014Jason and Tyrone\u2014are arguing or battling it out. It is a truly bravo performance by the actor.\n\nGeneva Carr as Margery is impressive as the impulsive, manic and fragile mother, still suffering the devastating loss of her husband and trying to communicate with her angry son. Carr gives us a heart-wrenching portrayal of a woman in a downward tailspin. Marc Kudisch is plain-speaking, vulnerable and lustful as Pastor Greg. He infuses the minister with a humane and caring quality as the commotion on stage becomes more volatile. Michael Oberholtzer is both menacing and childlike as the libidinous teenager Timothy and Sarah Stiles is soft-spoken, but quietly unflappable and courageous.\n\nDirector Moritz von Stuelpnagel adroitly brings out the disquietude within the production. He creates a controlled mayhem and methodical rhythm to the play. His foremost accomplishment is the work he has done with Boyer and Tyrone, both separately and as they meld into one. Even though the focus of the show is on twosome he secures passionate and animated performances from the other actors."},{"review":"The theatre is beautiful but the play is awful. If you need vulgarity and violence to be exposed to an existentialist take that \" hell is the others\" or that right,wrong and resligions are man-made up creations to explain away our failure to love and listen to others, then this is your show. If you rather partake of an intelligent conversation, then stay away."}]},{"nearBy":["Broadway","Lunt-Fontanne Theatre","Imperial Theatre"]}]},{"St.Luke'sPlace.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"Between Hudson St. and 7th Ave. S","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"En plein cœur de Greenwich Village, se trouve St Luke's place ... un très joli coin de quartier paisible datant des années 1850.\n\nUn alignement de 15 belles résidences borde le coté nord de cette rue.

It doesn't too crowded and you can enjoy the scenery of the Hudson River and Jersey."},{"review":"Amongst NYC Bridges, this one now the RFK formerly the Triborough is misnamed, its more than one bridge but is named as one and it provides access to Randall's and Ward's Island after coming from the Three Boroughs the formulate the tri- part of its name-Manhattan, Bronx, and Queens. The bridges are not that impressive really, they are set up in a suspension manner but arent at the level architecturally a bridge like the Verrazano is, they dont provide a great view of the three boroughs they cross into, they charge a toll each way, and they can be at times confusing given they form a three way connection. To walk or ride a bike across the bridge is rather unpleasent as the midspan of the bridge has no guard cage to prevent people from falling off into the Hell's Gate. On the Hell's Gate note, that is probably the best thing one can view on this bridge, the Hell's Gate rail bridge is parallel to the Queens leg of the bridge and it is a very impressive railroad bridge. Overall, it is not the best bridge in NYC but because it can connect three boroughs at once, it serves a purpose at least."},{"review":"The toll for this bridge is outrageous. I already pay city taxes and state taxes, why not lower the price to half of what it is now? RFK would by very upset if he were alive."},{"review":"The Triborough Bridge - officially the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge - was built in 1936 to connect Manhattan, the Bronx & Queens; the bridge's 3 spans all converge on Randalls Island-Wards Island (originally 2 islands, later connected with landfill); all 3 spans are open to pedestrians. This constitutes the only way for walkers to cross from the Bronx to Queens; the 2 other bridges - the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge & the Throgs Neck Bridge - do not have pedestrian access (& only the B-W is served by buses). On the Bronx side, pedestrian access is at 133rd Street & Cypress Place; you must climb many steps. The sidewalk is on the western side, providing good views to Midtown Manhattan, & Harlem. The bridge continues along the length of Randalls Island-Wards Island, but once on the island you must descend to the ground, again on steps, & walk on the road, with none too interesting scenery (the island is 1 1\/2 mi\/2 1\/2 km long). Close to the southern end of the island, you ascend to the bridge on a ramp; the sidewalk here is on the eastern side, giving a magnificent view of the Long Island Sound, & parts of the Bronx & Queens, all through the dark-red span of the Hell Gate Bridge, which carries only trains. Well in Queens, the access is on Hoyt Avenue N & 27th Street.\n If you're walking from Manhattan, the pedestrian access is at 125th Street & 2nd Avenue; but there are better options than the Triborough Bridge. If headed from Manhattan to the Bronx, it's much simpler to cross on the adjacent Willis Avenue Bridge; if going to Queens, the walk is a lot shorter crossing the shrill-green Wards Island Pedestrian Bridge (1951). To get to this, walk east on 102nd Street to the end, cross a pedestrian bridge over FDR Drive, & the WI Bridge is just to the north. On Wards Island, you can't walk straight east across the island, passing through the grounds of the gargantuan psychiatric hospital; instead, turn north along the shore, through pleasant parkland, with fine views across to East Harlem. At the Little Hell Gate inlet (the only remaining section of the sound that once separated the 2 islands), don't cross the picturesque wooden bridge; bear right, & you'll quickly come to the road on the island.\n The neighborhoods where the spans begin are all of interest; it is advisable to walk here with the architectural guidebook AIA GUIDE TO NEW YORK CITY, as each neighborhood has quite a bit to see. In Manhattan, the Triborough Bridge starts in Harlem, which is fascinating; check that review. The Wards Island Pedestrian Bridge starts in East Harlem, which is a separate, largely Hispanic, district; East Harlem, & to a lesser extent also Harlem, have their share of \"uglies\" - tall, bland, red-brick rental apartment buildings. But the shopping streets of East Harlem, especially 3rd Avenue, are always interesting; note the \"botanicas\" - stores selling all kinds of sacred paraphernalia & voodoo items! In the Bronx, the Triborough starts in Mott Haven, a mostly black neighborhood; New Yorkers often consider it dangerous, but during the day there shouldn't be a problem, & it's quite a beautiful district, with many architectural wonders, including Brooklynesque brownstones. In Queens, you'll be in Astoria, a historically Greek neighborhood, with Greek Orthodox churches & Greek writing on stores, not to mention many little eateries with delectable Greek cuisine. \n All in all, walking on the Triborough's spans is highly recommended!"},{"review":"This bridge connects three Boroughs: Manhattan, Bronx & Queens. Not the most impressive bridge I've seen, you pay a toll both ways and it is fairly expensive. The toll has been raised more times than I care to remember. \nTraffic comes at no charge, one of the frills of traveling through this area. I will never get used to it, but for manny motorists it's a way of life."}]},{"nearBy":["Bushwick Collective Street Art","The Brooklyn Tour","Kings County Distillery"]}]},{"Macy'sHeraldSquareHolidayGuidetoNewYork.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"151 West 34th Street","postalCode":"10001","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 12126954400"},{"reviews":[{"review":"There's no getting away from the fact that Macy's is iconic but it's in desperate need of some repair and dare I say it a clean.

It was a waste of two hours.. No setting, no curtains, no costumes, no substance. Once I realized that this would be it for the intermission-less performance, I thought, \"maybe the dialog and subject matter is so compelling, so important, that no additional embellishment is necessary.\" I was wrong. The entire play could have and should have been enacted in about 30 minutes. Instead it seemed every device was used to prolong the play to justify its 115 minute length:repetitive dialogue, s-l-o-w pacing, no dialogue. And the reward for the audience's patience? A predictable and unsatisfying ending. The only good thing about this play is that it has a limited engagement."},{"review":"We saw Wicked at the theatre and couldn't have asked for a better time.

What a great night of entertainment. Still humming the songs."},{"review":"Ok it hasn't opened yet but I was so excited to see this because of all the tap dancing in this musical. I saw it this week in previews and yes there are glorious tap dance numbers and two exciting male dancers that tap and dance like Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.\nThe show only has six people in the entire cast and it is in the smallest theater on Broadway. The show is long and boring. At times it was torture and so so dated. Expressions like ebbie jeebies, amscray, Mr. Roosevelt, the WPA, the glooms,2 bit phoney, buck-up, etc. were wasted on my Israeli friends and a younger population.\nThe dancers are consummate performers. They sing , act and dance. They are always on stage and never seem exhausted.\nThey are young and vibrant but alas the show is not.\nIt is a combination of Guys and Dolls, On The Town and 42nd Street. But on a very small scale. It is also honky tonk vaudeville or cabaret. The show is corny.\nThe audience was papered or cast family members and friends were there and it was so inappropriate with applauds and loud cheers.\nJohn Bolton is wonderful as Hennessy. Lesli Margherita plays Mona Kent to the hill and is far too exaggerated at times and is too much of a caricature.\nThank you Randy Skinner for the beautiful, exciting choreography. The 2 male dancers were superb.\nand That's All Folks"},{"review":"One of top3 to do in NY is to watch a broadway musical.

First done in the 60's DAMES spoofs those wonderful Warner Brothers Busby Berkley musicals of the early 30's, but not with a cast of thousands but six talented singers, dancers, actors who always seem to be tapping away. The music is delightful and beautifully delivered by a stellar cast. The dancing never ends and that's a good thing. The story, well it's just plain silly, but so what. It makes you laugh non stop in a time when laughter is a premium. When the cast learns that the theatre is being torn down, they perform their show on a U.S. Battleship. To find out how they engage a battleship, you'll have to see the show. Of course the leading lady takes ill and can't perform but not to despair; our ingenue from Idaho will learn the role in no time flat, while tapping, tapping and tapping. \"Honey, you're going out on that poop deck a chorus girl, but you're coming back a star\"."}]},{"nearBy":["Gershwin Theater","Neil Simon Theatre","Times Square Church"]}]},{"EastVillageVisitorsCenter.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"308 Bowery St.","postalCode":"10012","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212.614.8702"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"My friend and I took Bowery tour with Rob yesterday and my experience is similar to other people \u2013 tour was great.

The \"Dark Purple\" smooth leather was paper thin and so badly dyed it appeared brown. The large flap was lined with \"Pleather\" and when I opened the box the plastic smell was very evident.

Can't recommend it any more, sadly."},{"review":"I was in New York for my 21st birthday and my mum wanted to buy me something nice so I got a Henri Bendel purse and a lovely keepsake ring! The staff were so helpful and friendly! However after wearing the ring once a stone fell from it (just a faulty one) I was so upset I wouldn't of been able to get it changed as I had come back home to Ireland however the company sent me another one out with fast delivery! I'm over the moon with it and can't thank the staff enough! I will definitely be back!!"},{"review":"I'm a long time Bendel's \"devotee\". I remember shopping in the original 57th street store with my mom, and and being awed by the gorgeous, cutting edge merchandise. I even worked there one Christmas, and it was a really special experience. Once they were bought by the Limited, the slow, depressing slide began. Slowly but surely everything that made the store unique and special disappeared. The phenomenal clothing and home goods depts. were eliminated. The jewelry department remained exciting, showcasing new and talented designers...I hadn't been back to the store since last summer, and popped in yesterday. To say I was simultaneously shocked, dismayed and depressed would be an understatement. Not only had Bendel's gotten rid of all \"third party\" items and designers-I was told by a robotic salesgirl that they now only sold \"HB\" items. The HB \"brand\" is some of the tackiest, fugliest, blandest crap I've ever seen. It's become a tourist trap, appealing to those from the \"hinterlands\" who are naive enough to think that this Bendels resembles anything remotely \"New York\". Most of the second floor has been walled off, and the clueless staff has no idea what the space will be used for. Except for a bunch of giddy out of towners milling excitedly about, the store was eerily, sadly empty. I have a feeling it's going to close shortly, though the same salesgirl told me that they \"sell more now\" than previously. That's because there are Bendel's \"outlets\" in malls across America, carrying the same junk, and the out of towners think the 5th Ave. store is somehow \"cool\". Another piece of genuine Manhattan, obliterated."},{"review":"Had a ball shopping- lots to see - lots to buy- staff is helpful and easy to find. place is A fun place to see if in NYC"},{"review":"Awesome bags , beautiful location on 5th avenue, sometimes sale up to 50% for handbags.

A very nice lady helped me out and explained where I how to fix problems with the zipper on the handbag. Since my city doesn't carry Henri Bendel she helped me same their new fragrance and even bought a fall hat.\n\nShe arranged for free shipping since the hat should not be \"crushed\" in my suitcase and agreed to send the fragrance with it. She gave me a tour of the store. In addition to handbags they carry outerwear, jewelry, candles and even have a clearance department.\n\nWhen I returned from my trip my articles arrived the day after I got home. Inside they also threw in a free tote which was probably part of a promo they were having. It was a well made tote.\n\nI was very grateful for my finds and really enjoyed my visit. \n\nHenri Bendel can be pricey but their quality is on the same order as Coach or Michael Kors. They usually offer discount coupons if you sign up on their mailing list or acquired their credit card.\n\nYou can purchase on-line as well and if you aren't happy with your purchase you may return it to any store or return it by mail.\n\nI have been to their flagship store in the past over the holidays and found they have one of the best holiday windows on display."}]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"KentshireGalleries.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"700 Madison Avenue","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" +1 212-421-1100"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"I first discovered Kentshire Galleries in the late 1980's whilst shopping in Bergdorf Goodman in New York.

Were I in a seat in the middle of the row, I doubt I could have gone the evening without inconveniencing neighbors as there simply was no way to put my legs in front of my own seat. \n\nIt is a shame, as the rest of the theater is filled with the sort of ornamentation that makes a Broadway evening so special. Perhaps the main floor is more spacious, but the mezzanine was most uncomfortable.\n\nWere this evening not saved by the incredible talents of Mirren, I would not be likely to return to this particular Broadway theater. I hope they renovate soon -- or at least don't play host to anything I truly want to see, before they do!"},{"review":"We (I) love Helen Mirren, so of course we had to visit New York for her short run as Queen Elizabeth in the play The Audience (at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater).\n\nThe acoustics in this small theater are good (I have some hearing loss, so did need to work at catching the dialogue of the two main women actresses). The overall experience was just what I wanted, and the theater and play well worth your effort. Seats make the stage very accessible, the stairs to mezzanine navigable, exits available, and staff helpful."},{"review":"Have seen many plays in the UK but this was my first trip to New York and first experience of a Broadway play. \n\nThe theatre we attended, The Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, was seeped in atmosphere. Period fixtures and fittings adorned the outside of the building as well as inside. Staff were friendly and bathrooms conveniently located throughout. \n\nOn our visit, we had booked to see The Audience with Helen Mirren. The performance was outstanding, nothing less. Sound and lighting fantastic. \n\nSeating was good and as far as I could make out, all seats provided a good view within the compact theatre. \n\nWe were blessed with great seats but we had just one small niggle. I was cursed with a fidgeter seated directly in front of me. The young woman in question, decided to sit up high at times, sit forward at times, sit back with a woolen hat on and sometimes reach inside her jumper to grapple with an itch on her back. My tutting and heavy groans of annoyance were ignored. If it were not for the truly brilliant performance from the genius that is Helen Mirren, my whole experience would have been ruined. But Dame Helen shone brightly in her perfectly played part as The Queen and through side way and overhead glimpses I managed to enjoy the play. \n\nThe icing on the cake for me, was the close proximity of the stage door to the public entrance\/exit doors. Dame Helen made her way out just minutes after the play and kindly signed any autograph booklets presented to her. I was met with a smile and the reply \"Another Brit\" when I thanked her for the autograph. Of course this instantly erased any memory of the fidgeting person in front of me. \n\nAn atmospheric theatre with good seating and a truly memorable performance, thanks to Helen Mirren and cast."},{"review":"Went to see The Audience. Dame Helen Mirren was fantastic! Her Prime Ministers were excellent as well! The young Elizabeth doesn't get the attention she should. She is a great talent, too! The space was old and beautiful. People that have mobility issues need to be careful as the floor is not level and the seats are packed in close... but well worth the show! So glad we got to see this performance, in this great theater!"}]},{"nearBy":["Majestic Theatre","Imperial Theatre","St. James Theater"]}]},{"GodivaChocolatier.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"650 5th Ave","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" (212) 664-1258"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"I bought a chocolate pack to give as a gift to a friend whom I was seeing that evening.

Lincoln Center is a very special place, and I fear that a lot of people who would share that sentiment skip it, because part of its reputation is that it is a haven for snobs, and that is true to a certain extent -- you still can get people at the box offices that have an attitude that is stupid and tiresome. But it isn't anywhere near as bad as it used to be. And there has never been such a variety of performances available at LC as you can find today. As I write this, the Metropolitan Opera season is underway, the Nutcracker will be starting in a few weeks, but Twyla Tharp will be at the former NY State Theater before that, the Philharmonic is at David Geffen Hall, and Lincoln Center Theater offers the King and I, a fantastic new play called Dada Woof, Papa Hot and a very good play Kill Floor is at the Claire Tow. Never mind what may be happening at Alice Tully Hall, Julliard, the Film Society...Plus, just across the street from the campus is the David Rubinstein Atrium which has a half-price ticket booth inside. Availability is inconsistent, and many times, you can get a better price for a seat at the box office, because the Atrium only has half price off premium seats. But it's worth checking. Also has a very clean public toilet, a snack and sandwich stand.

In 1954 Robert Moses himself, yes, the same Moses that single-handedly destroyed the Bronx, picked this location, in order to gentrify the decaying area (some of the scenes of West Side Story were shot in the old very realistic slums). Funds came from two generations of Rockefellers and others and eventually, the complex was built in 1961. The several buildings included in the area are all Arts-related. They have undergone some transformations and name changes, but the beautiful black marble fountain is still there unchanged. Double dutch contests, wedding photo sessions and always people watching other people surround the fountain. \n The David Geffen Hall & David Koch American Ballet Theater face each other in proud challenge just like their real life politics. The Metropolitan Opera, so beautifully in the background of Moonstruck, pompously shows its Chagall paintings which the artist helped install (in a very unfortunate location, as it turned out, since they are all hidden behind the windows grid). Behind the Opera you\u2019ll find the reflecting pool with Moore statues. Summer & Fall Arts & Crafts fairs are staged around the pool which creates even more opportunity for reflection photography. The New York Library for the Performing Art which often features interesting free exhibits in its lobby (currently Alice is visiting, no hares or mad hatters though, only Al Hirschfeld's desk) is between the reflective pool and the Met. The theater building is now a triple venue and Movie goers will find the New York Film Festival in the Film building adjacent to the pool every fall. Cross the street and you\u2019ll be in Alice Tully Hall. Check out the schedule! \n Movie lovers will recognize the settings of Lincoln Center in variety of movies, including Serpico, Ghostbusters, The Producers, Sweet home Alabama and many others.\n Go at sunset and enjoy the last rays of sunshine on the huge arched windows, sit by the fountain and practice some people watching, then walk across and do some serious shopping at Century 21."},{"review":"Beautiful venues on one stunning campus.

But sometimes the Lincoln Center does have events available to the public, and that's good. The Lincoln Center is a place to experience high quality art and presentation. The place has got a bit of a snobby vibe, but if you can get past that\u2013 the venue and it's various curated shows and events are certainly things to see. You have to go to the Lincoln Center at least once, if you want to fully experience some of the high quality elements of New York."},{"review":"We took the guided tour of the Lincoln center and it was wonderful, we were lucky enough to catch 3 rehersals: opera at the met,the NY ballet and the NY philarmonic.

We deliberately chose not to go on the Daily Tour but on the Art and Architecture tour. However the guide didn't really focus on those subjects at all. Whilst she did mention a couple of things about the architecture the art was pretty much off the agenda. I think that the Lincoln Centre is going to advertise specialised Art and Architecture tours then these should be special tours and not what seemed to be just the usual daily tour however good that might be."},{"review":"The fountains and wide plaza provide seating for gazing at the sculptures and pool. This Center is a great place to see and hear a concert, opera or musical or the ballet. If you are visiting NYC this is the cultural center. The Vivian Beaumont Theatre is an amazing venue and seating is excellent but there isn't much leg room. We saw \"The King and I\" and it's an American classic, well performed and we'll produced with beautiful costumes and sets."}]},{"nearBy":["New York City Ballet (NYCB)","New York Public Library for the Performing Arts","The Juilliard School"]}]},{"HealthClubs(10).html":[{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"FranklinBowlesGalleryNYC.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"435 W.

(That doesn't always happen in art galleries, you know.) We really liked the works on display by Agusti Puig, a new artist they're representing. It was abstract, lots of blacks and whites. Soon one of the consultants approached us, handed us a price list and explained a bit more about Puig. He also encouraged us to check out other works on display.\n\nWe took our time, didn't feel rushed and saw all of the art. We knew there was one piece that really hit us, but we wanted to think about it and see a few other galleries. \n\nAfter visiting quite a few other places in Chelsea and Soho, we instantly realized what a gem we'd found at Franklin Bowles. Buying art should be fun and enjoyable. The staff at FB did an excellent job of making us feel welcome, while educating us in a way that wasn't condescending in any way.

The current assortment of Tudor City tudor styled apartment buildings were constructed by Fred French in the 1920's demolishing some 19th Century Brownstone \/ Italianate Row Houses and keeping a few that still survive on East 41 Street and East 43rd Street. Of all the buildings in Tudor City Historic District, my favorite would be 5 Tudor City Place (aka Windsor Tower, as all the buildings have named designations as well as addresses) for its large footprint, beautiful lobby and limestone first floor construction. All the buildings are equally breath taking. I would strongly advise that you do an internet search for \"Tudor_City_Historic_District.pdf\" which is a NYC Official Landmarks Preservation 86 page doc listing the history and all the buildings in the area with photos and drawings. \n\nDefinitely a must see in NYC ......\nEnjoy!"},{"review":"Tudor City is a unique apartment \"complex\" that anyone can enter to enjoy the views and parks.

I found this to be charming because it gives a sense that you are entering someone's home and not just a museum. It is dark inside with the shutters drawn in every room for the most part. I felt that this gave an accurate representation of what the house might have felt like in the 18th and 19th centuries with only candlelight and sunlight available. I also think that the shutters were drawn to minimize sun exposure to the delicate fabrics abundant in each room, whether in the form of carper, wallpaper, or textiles.

This is a must see for architects, anyone interested in early US history, architecture, and\/ or interior designers who have clients who live in neo-Federalist style residencies and need to see how certain rooms were set up or decorated. OR anyone who wants to see this really cool place from the mid-18th C.\/ Pre-Revolutionary Period . Designed by a British officer who was an architural auture. When he left to return to Mother England to fight the Colonists just noit from his house, the Mansion was more or less hijacked\/squatted by Washington, Hamilton and others as a HQ during the Battle of Haarlem Heights. The Mansion was was purchased by French wine merchant, Msr. Jumel from the British Officer\/Architect when he returned permanently to England sometime in the beginning of the 19th C. On one of Mr. Jumel's biz trips to France he met a high-end courtesan to the Wealthy, who tbecame Madame Jumel when they returned the newly formed US. Although they had no children of their own they did raise the children of their siblings, as their own. [??] The mysterious circumstances surrounding her late husbands death is speculative and cannot be proven that she is a black widow spider of sorts. However it was curious that her marriage to Pres. Aaron Burr followed suspiciously close to the death of her first husband. Aaron Burr's demise is even more interesting, though his libidinal impulses very likely contributed to his demise as well. A demise the female house servants were probabaly glad to hear. THe museum hosts many events among which include a Halloween slumber party when other fun factoids and tour of the museum are given. There have been stories of hearing Madame Jumel screaming, and seeing some incarnation of the ghost of Aaron Burr [mostly his boots]; other experiences employees have had aside from all the above were the sound of the harpsichord being played in the octoganal room, On days when the museum is closed. No one employed thereplays the harpsichord. THe octoganal room is acoustically well suited for musical events. Real musical events that I attended was Brooklyn Baroque with a real harpsichordist playing. As well as a string Baroque Quartet [for my friend's wedding]. Accoustically the octagonal room is probably the most ideal since the sound resonates around the room beautifullywith the wood floors and lathe walls [in spite of the fact there are windows]. When there are few visitors in the museum, one can feel the energy of Washington, Hamilton and others. The energy of Madame Jumel can be especially felt as you walk by her apartments within the Mansion. I hope I have the cursory history correct, there is a chance I might have either left out or misspelled a few words. I don't know when the spelling of Harlem changed. It's also interesting to note that on the way to the museum you will walk by Langston Hughes', Duke Ellington's and Count Basie's apartment buidings along with other famous musicians and writers.

The fort itself was a pretty cool structure, and the uses it has had throughout its history is fascinating. However, the inside was pretty much a ticket booth for the Statue of Liberty. I love learning about historical sites, but inside there were only 1 or 2 displays, and most people were just passing through to get to the Statue of Liberty. It still is worth a quick visit if you are in the area or going to the Statue of Liberty, but definitely not as a stand alone attraction."},{"review":"There's really not much of interest here, unless you happen to be looking to buy tickets to visit the Statue of Liberty. The structure is nice enough, but more could be done to make it more attractive. And perhaps consider selling the tickets to the Statue of Liberty somewhere else."},{"review":"Stopped by this National Monument while looking to purchase tickets for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Being the Memorial Day Weekend, there were lines, more lines, and then more lines. However, nobody was at the monument. Instead, they were all buying tickets. Castle Clinton is very interesting inside and out. Inside it contains a historic exhibit of changes of this artillery station. It is a beautiful brownstone monument with a castle type top.Interesting history. A great photo op. A nice place to visit."},{"review":"Castle Clinton sits in Battery Park, formerly some sort of artillery defense for New York in its past (1812 I think?). From a distance it looks like a round rotunda with a typical castle-like top, all in brownstone. When you enter you will find long lines, but almost none with any interest in actually seeing Castle Clinton, instead most people enter the Castle merely to buy tickets to the Statue Cruise. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I am a strong proponent of living history. But for living history the building in question must actually serve a purpose relative to its original use. As a former artillery station, this is not practical. However, to use it as a ticket booth seems almost absurd. It seems like someone in charge had no idea what to actually do with this national monument, ergo established it as the ticket booth to purchase tickets to Ellis Island and Liberty Island. There are ample other places where the ticket booth can be moved. It would be amazing to see such a move take place, followed by a concerted effort to transform Castle Clinton. With so many towering skyscrapers, numerous subways, and masses of people, it is easy to forget New York's humble beginnings. Restoration of this monument could bring that alive, and more! Until then, enjoy the architecture, buy your tickets to see Ellis and Liberty, and move on."},{"review":"Castle Clinton is one I overlooked on my first visit to NYC but on my recent visit we decided to stop by.

We were told to stop by the ranger office to ask for a tour. We didn't, but I wish now that we would have because my bet is that it would have been interesting and provided even more information about this neat site. This site also is where you can purchase tickets for seeing the Statue of Liberty. There is a very well stocked gift shop. It has lots of things specific to Lady Liberty, as well as about NYC in general. The clerk, King, was so helpful and friendly. He was able to provide us with other sightseeing information."},{"review":"So the Castle is undergoing a little renovation so there are parts of it that aren't accessible - but there is a neat junior ranger program the kids did (ask for a booklet at the ranger station) that both they and I learned a lot by completing - they also got a neat (and free) badge when they completed it. The staff is very nice, and since you have to go through it to get on the ferry to the statue of liberty - it's definitely worth a look!"},{"review":"This isn't all that much of a big deal, in some ways, but 8 million immigrants came through here prior to the opening of Ellis Island as a getaway to the United States.

I love it just like every other new yorker, but if you are a tourist and want to see the cool stuff that all of the tourist DON'T flock to, I would suggest going to see this park. It's at the very top of Manhattan and right along the water. There are great paths that lead up through a forest where there are still caves left from years and years ago when the indians lived there. The only thing I would suggest: if you go walking through the forest paths, don't go alone. Although there can sometimes be a fair amount of people back there, it can get a little spooky by yourself."},{"review":"Love this place. I visited this park a few years ago and the area has definitely changed. Lots of smaller (hipsterish) cafes and stores have been opening. Parking is just as tough though, since there are tons of apartment buildings. I was lucky enough to snag a spot about a block away from the park's entrance point at 218th Street and Indian Road. There was a party or two going on there as well as a baseball game. Lovely views of Columbia, and Henry Hudson Bridge. The main path of the park is fairly small. There are paths though that lead into the \"woods\". The one we took was the path you take if you stay to the far right until you reach a hill hat you climbs. Along the right side of the that entire path is a steep drop so be careful. That path goes directly under the Henry Hudson bridge and leads toward Fort Tryon Park and the waterside there along the Hudson. It is a good walk with hills, so the casual walker may be sore the following day, but the view along the way are beautiful. From there, you can head to Dyckman, which leads to the street. You can choose to stay int he park and waIk south toward the GWB, where again there are beautiful views and the little red lighthouse. I would recommend anyone spend a few hours there navigating the paths. It is nice having a forest-like path but being only a few blocks away from \"civilization\". Lots of biking and dog walking by the way. Also, you may want to bring along some water, since the path, depending on which ones you take, can take a while to navigate. On a fall day, it should be okay, but on a humid, hot, summer day, you will get tired and thirsty."}]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"BeekmanPlace.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"East of 1st Ave. between E. 49th and E. 51st Sts.","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"This is not really a tourist destination; nor is there anything much of interest to see in this East side neighborhood very near the East River.

Take the A, B or C lines north to the 145th station, and once on the street stroll north past (or through) St. Nicholas Park to 141st, turn left and you are there in half a block. A free experience, the home is beautiful inside and out. Be sure to watch the background video, as well as the displays about the movement of the house (a technical miracle through NYC). It still sits on what once was the origina estate of Hamilton. Check the NPS website, but it is open 9-5, Wednesday through Sunday's. Guided tours go at 10, 11, 2 and 4. Self-guided tours are also available. Why is Hamilton so important? Aide de camp to Washington during the Revolution, took part in the storming of Yorktown, first Secretary of the Treasury, assumed the former colonies'\/states' war debts (restoring a full fIth and credit Tao the Nation, paid off those debts,through trade agreements and tariffs, founded the Federalist political party and avoided war with revolutionary France during the 1790s. He was also a firm advocate of a strong central government, and was a prime mover in returning to good commercial and political relations with Britain. With all this on his list of things ŵon, why was he never president? He couldn't! He was born on the Caribbean island of Nevis, and thus not a \"native born\" American. All he got was his picture on the $10 bill. Oh, and a Bullet from Aaron Burr after a political feud among these New Yorkers (and a few well placed slurs about his personal life from Burr). Unfortunately, the guided tour covers only the \"public rooms', but nor the bedrooms upstairs. The guides are excellent and very proud of thei new location. St. Nicholas Park is also a joy to stroll through. There are several restaurants close by (Cafe One, King Gourmet Deli, Subway) since City College of New York is right around the corner. Enjoy."},{"review":"Great place to visit if you are interested in American History! Nice 15-20 minute video on the life of Alexander Hamilton. If you're in the area, go ahead and stop by!"},{"review":"We ventured excitedly uptown one Sunday eve to visit the famed Hamilton Grange, the only home ever owned by Alexander Hamilton, a key figure in the birth of this country, and the development of our nation's financial system, along many other things. A real American success story, but foolish and prideful enough to die in a duel over some name calling. \n\nWell, upon entering the Grange's foyer\/gift shop, fortunately, the first person you meet is Gregory Mance, a Park Ranger who looks more like a Army Ranger, who seemed to know more about the house and its contents than any of the tour guides. So before I say anything, I have to give major kudos to Ranger Mance.\n \nAnyway, after perusing all the information downstairs, and watching the brief, but interesting, 15 minute movie about AH's life story, we enthusiastically headed upstairs to view the main floor of the house, expecting to see some real history. The upstairs landing had a full 10ft portrait of the man himself in all his splendor...unfortunately, that was not the original painting, but a replica. The original is in Arkansas at the Wal Mart museum. OK, no problem. There also was a marble bust of AH in the foyer, but again a replica. Then we went into the study, and marveled at his rolltop desk and chair, and thought, can you imagine, he actually sat at the desk on that chair and wrote political pamphlets---wait, never mind, they are period pieces, but not original furniture from his house. We stepped across to the dining room, and yes, nope, not original, although I understand the wine cooler was a present from GW. However, I only found that it was a genuine piece after our visit, so I didn't even notice it at the time. Of course the prized piece of original furniture in the house is the piano Forte, a gift from AH's sister in law. Located in the salon, unfortunately, it was placed at the far end of the room, well past the velvet rope, so one could barely see it, but understandably so, to keep it away from wandering hands. \n\nAlas, the upstairs bedrooms were off limits to visitors. And that was about it. The final rooms were dedicated to explaining the federal design of the house, and the process of actually moving it from its original location a few blocks away to the current, more suitable and convenient location. So the house is not even located in its original location. \n\nAll in all, while it was fun to visit the Grange, one just didn't get the usual thrill when viewing true history, since much of it was diluted with replica and period pieces rather than original items. It definitely is still worth a visit, but I wouldn't get your hopes up too high."}]},{"nearBy":["Harlem","Convent Avenue Baptist Church","Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture"]}]},{"GreeleySquarePark.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"Broadway, Ave of Americas","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"If you're in the area while it lasts and if the wheather is nice, it's a great place to have lunch or a dinner.

What is sure is that he supported Lincoln during the Civil War and promoted the idea of a transcontinental railroad. \n The Tribune has the doubtful distinction of hiring Karl Marx as foreign correspondent and publishing 500 articles of his and Englels, even if Greeley sometimes disagreed with the material. \n He traveled extensively in the West and met people as different as Brigham Young (whom he interviewed) and Mark Twain, he even ran for president and lost to Grant. The loss devastated him and he died withing weeks of the defeat.\n The Square today is populated with all kind of high cholesterol junk food vendors (it's ironic that it was created as part of Mayor Bloomberg's initiative for healthier and cleaner city).

Mr Ruggles, who created the park and the earliest buildings surrounding it, used the private park, based on the British model of parks, as an incentive to get residents to move uptown (at the time) to live here. The park itself is an oasis of calm and is very quiet and soothing. However, it has strict rules. Only residents of buildings facing the park and the Gramercy Park Hotel can gain access. There are usually two days in the spring and fall when the park is free and open to the public. Walking around the park is relaxing and it is fun to look at the very expensive properties that surround it. Many celebrities and famous people live on the park, but I do not think it is right to mention names. ( I live in the neighborhood a block and a half away.)

If we only consider what's on display, my rating would have been a bit higher (even though I was expecting something else, it was quite interesting).

Even if they were meant to be dirty pictures, they look so classy! nothing to do with the pictures you may take with your iPhone which make you look cheap) and the cheeky old cartoons! So funny!\nThe interactive room seemed interesting, however I guess it would have been much more enjoyable if I had been there with my partner. I was there with a friend so we were just fooling around to make it less awkward.\n\nAnd here comes the reason why my rating is so low: They forced me to leave my little backpack (it's not even a proper backpack, it's more like a purse\/backpack sort of thing if you know what I mean) in the cloakroom and pay 2$ for the storage. I had no pockets so I had to carry my wallet,cell phone and passport in my hand throughout the visit, which was quite a pain and ruined the experience. Only to realise that many people were carrying around way bigger backpacks and handbags. Even huge shopping bags (and not from their store)! Totally unfair! When I asked the lady at the cloakroom if it was mandatory, she said it was, so I left it there even though I wasn't happy about it. Rules are rules after all. But later I discovered thouse rules apparently only applied to me. And to make matters worse, she had the balls to ask for a tip when we collected the backpack! Do your job properly and then we'll talk!. \nSo just in case you are randomly selected to leave your bag at the cloakroom, be prepared and make sure your trousers have enough pockets to put all your valuables in them!\n\nSumming up, if you hold the New York pass and have some time to kill, give it a go.

Tickets on the night I visited were $15, $18, and $20. The complex occupies a former supermarket, the name of which is still engraved above the marquee. The art gallery is in the rather long L-shaped lobby, and admission to it is free. A small bar offers a few bottled beers and a couple of wines, along with coffee and I think tea. There was some mention of cookies too, but I didn't see any. Patrons are permitted to being their drinks into the auditoria. \n\nI had occasion to speak with several of the staff, and all were quite friendly and engaging. These people seem pleased and proud to be involved in their work, and that's a definite plus. \n\nYou'll see some interesting and provocative shows here, no doubt about that. I had a hard time choosing between two on the night I visited; both intrigued me. \n\nBut there's somewhat of a shoestring-budget feel to the place. Of course, you're not paying Broadway prices, and you shouldn't expect Broadway glamour. Still, most of the padded-cloth chairs for my show had visible stains; a little Re-Nuzit could fix that. Worse, at least on that particular night. there was no air conditioning. It was rather warm, and I can understand having to decide based on budget, but it bordered on uncomfortable. A trip to the restroom facilities, located downstairs in a basement level, was kinda spooky: apparently they store Hallowe'en decorations down there. \n\nI would recommend TNC for those of an artistic and adventurous bent, especially those on a budget.

The second floor has primitive icons and beautifully embroidered blouses from the areas where Shevchenko lived. The basement has two exhibits, more interesting to me are photos of Crimean Tartars.

The best thing about this museum? It's incredibly well-curated. Smaller, lesser-known museums sometimes tend to display nearly every piece of their collection in no particular order and completely overwhelm the visitor. Not so the Ukrainian Museum - in each exhibit we saw, the pieces were thoughtfully selected and arranged.

It is inexpensive and small enough for a quick visit while you are in the area."},{"review":"The museum\u2019s name should really be changed, since \u201CUkrainian Museum\u201D suggests a general focus on the history of the Ukrainian diaspora in the U.S. and Ukraine in general. The Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles does exactly this, and the Ukrainian equivalent seems to be the Ukrainian National Museum in Chicago. A better name for the New York museum would be: \u201CMuseum of Ukrainian Folk and Modern Art,\u201D because that is what the museum is. As another reviewer notes, the museum is small, without a permanent exhibit but rather rotating exhibits drawn from what seems to be an extensive collection. The museum has enough space, however, to allow for a general display that would appeal to the visiting tourist who will likely have only a single opportunity to benefit from the museum\u2019s collection. A display of pysanky, rushnyky, folk instruments, and a photographic display of the Ukrainian community in the U.S. would provide outreach and education while better meeting visitors\u2019 expectations.\n\nAs it was, the museum was completely empty when my wife and I visited over the three-day Martin Luther King holiday weekend. While not of Ukrainian origin ourselves, we lived in Kyiv from 2005-2008 so we do know Ukrainian history and culture fairly well. I found the Ukrainian kilim carpet exhibit to be quite worthwhile and interesting. We had never seen such kilims at the various museums we visited in Ukraine, so we appreciated seeing the examples of Ukrainian folk art and accomplishments about which we were unaware. Previously, we connected kilims just to Turkey and Central Asia. Several of the kilims were also very beautiful (my wife enjoys textiles of all types), and I was struck by the similarities of one or two to what I understand to be Navajo rugs. I was intrigued to find artisans from two different continents creating very similar objects. I was also impressed by the striking and unusual color combinations used in several kilims. We also liked the Christmas puppet explanation and display at the entrance. The museum will never be particularly successful, however, until its permanent exhibit better meets tourists\u2019 expectations for it, which is quite unfortunate."},{"review":"The Museum is tiny and has little of interest unless you like rugs or one artist from the 1960s. very disappointed"},{"review":"The current exhibits are focused but very different.

We were given a tour of the collection by Olena. You need know nothing of art. Olena's enthusiasm, knowledge, and presentation will draw you in.

The views are pretty lame compared to the Hudson, mostly over abandoned warehouses and apartment buildings being constructed, but the facilities and layout make it great for a walk or jog. The open track here also helps. It's a bit difficult to find the entrances as you have to get across the FDR."},{"review":"East River Park is not very well-known by tourists, but it should be. The elongated park is located along the East River - which is actually a sound, not a river - between 12th Street & Jackson Street, & abuts the East Village, the Lower East Side & Chinatown. On the western side are the usual ugly red-brick high-rise apartment buildings that are common in parts of New York, but the views to the east are hard to beat, toward Queens, Brooklyn & the Williamsburg Bridge. The gardening in the park is pretty, too, & squirrels frolic between the trees.\n There are plans to extend the East River Greenway from the lower tip of Manhattan all the way to Harlem. At the time of writing, you can walk from the Whitehall Ferry Terminal (where the Staten Island ferry departs), as far as 37th Street in Midtown, all the time with scenic views. Stuyvesant Cove, at around 20th Street, is lovely. \n You cannot walk along the water passing the United Nations complex. At 49th Street is the very pleasant Peter Detmold Park along the waterside, but it ends at 51st Street, where there is a pedestrian bridge leading up to the bluff, among expensive apartment buildings. At the eastern dead end of 53rd & 54th Streets is Sutton Place Park, but at the latter street you have to continue northwards on the street called Sutton Place. At the ends of 55th, 56th, 57th & 58th Streets are small parklets overlooking the water; don't miss the statue of a wild boar (1972; copy of an Italian one from 1634) at 57th Street. \n You pass under the great Queensborough Bridge at 59th & 60th Streets, & at 63rd Street the riverwalk starts again. Despite the incessant noise from FDR Drive, this too is a beautiful walk along the water's edge, with lovely views of Roosevelt Island, & the Queensborough & Triborough Bridges. At 78th Street, a pedestrian bridge leads up to John Jay Park, named after an important early American statesman; here are restroom facilities, as well as a good view.\n Continuing at the water's edge, at 81st Street you have to go up on a pedestrian bridge to the bluff, & continue your walk there. At 84th Street you enter the beautiful Carl Schurz Park, & pass through it, viewing the lighthouse at the top of Roosevelt Island, & parts of Queens. You can still continue north, again along the water's edge, for quite a long way, passing East Harlem (a mostly Puerto Rican neighborhood), then Harlem proper. North of about 105th Street, you can see, in all its glory, the huge bulk of the psychiatric hospital on Wards Island.\n You proceed on the Bobby Wagner Walk, & at 111th Street is a pedestrian bridge up to Thomas Jefferson Park. For a park named after maybe the country's greatest president, the park is nothing special (mostly sports facilities), but there are 2 interesting & photogenic modern sculptures. The walk ends at 120th Street, where you walk up a pedestrian bridge into Harlem, which is also worth a walk, or several! Don't think that Harlem is very dangerous - it's not! Be sure to have a bite in a local eatery."},{"review":"As another reviewer notes, the East River Park runs (intermittently) along the east side of the city. The city is in the process of improving a number of sections, and linking them all, to make the East Side riverfront as nice as the West Side, but it's still something of a work in progress. The Upper East Side section, from 60th to 91st Streets (with another entrance at 78th) is particularly appealing for a stroll , especially at the northern end, near the Mayor's residence Gracie Mansion in lovely Carl Schurz Park(with terrific kids' playgrounds). The paved esplanade is very wide and relatively uncrowded, offering great views of Queens and Roosevelt Island, as well as temptingly close glimpses into some stately riverfront apartment houses, and plenty of benches for sitting and reading or just contemplating the water."}]},{"nearBy":["Lower East Side","Nuyorican Poet's Cafe","The Lower East Side Jewish Conservancy"]}]},{"ObscuraAntiques&Oddities.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"207 Avenue A","postalCode":"10009","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" (212) 505-9251"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"An amazing shop, filled with highly covetable items that I couldn't possibly bring home (not sure Her Majesty's Customs would appreciate me trying to import a pickled monkey head in a jar).

Many, many galleries from all over the world representing many great well known as well as emerging photographers."},{"review":"My spouse and I attended a show at the Park Avenue Armory in late December 2014. We were looking for something to do for an hour or so in the Midtown East\/Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, and the Armory seemed to be the right choice. This facility is located on (surprise!) Park Avenue, between East 66th and East 67th Streets.\n\nThe National Guard\u2019s seventh regiment (which included famous families like the Roosevelts, Van Rensselaers, Livingtons, Stewarts, and Harrimans) completed building the Armory in 1881. Many of those well-known families later hired the decorators from the Armory (such as Louis Comfort Tiffany and Stanford White) to work in their own mansions. The period rooms of the Armory show a collection of 19th century interiors.\n\nThe facility provides a four-page printed guide with which guests can take a self-directed tour of the first-floor reception rooms and drill hall. On the first floor, visitors can view the hallways and staircase, veterans room and library (with interiors by Louis Comfort Tiffany), field & staff room (recent renovations revealed elaborate stencil work near the wainscoting), and ladies reception room (which showcases Minton art tiles in the fireplace hearth). Be sure to examine the mahogany woodwork and wainscoting and the original lighting and chandeliers.\n\nThe second-floor rooms are accessible only via a 75-minute guided tour, which occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10:00 am. Some walking and stair climbing is necessary, although an elevator is available for those with mobility issues. The front entrance of the Armory requires climbing quite a few steps, but an accessible entrance is available on 60th Street if you call ahead.\n\nRestrooms are located on the lower (basement) level. A coat check is available on the first floor, along with a salon where you can enjoy drinks and simple snacks.\n\nThe draw of this building is the Wade Thompson Drill Hall, which encompasses 55,000 square feet of space. The Hall is the largest unobstructed (open and without columns) exhibition space in the city. The hall reminds visitors of a train station, with its 80-foot-high barrel-vaulted roof with eleven elliptical wrought iron arches. The drill hall provides space for unconventional visual and performing arts performances that cannot be staged in traditional museums and performance halls.\n\nWe attended a show called \u201CTears Become \u2026 Streams Become\u201D, staged by Turner Prize-winning artist Douglas Gordon and acclaimed pianist Helene Grimaud. A pool in the main armory exhibition space was filled with water, atop which rested two floating platforms that held grand pianos. Performances were held several times throughout the month, but during regular exhibition times (not performances), player pianos were supposed to play music. \nDisappointingly, on the day that we visited, no musical component was available. (The admission price was reduced from $15 to $8 as compensation; the full show\/performances cost $50+.) The visual effect when guests first entered the darkened hall, with the reflection of the arched ceiling in the water below, was breathtaking yet a bit dizzying, because it turned the Armory\u2019s iconic architecture seemingly upside down!\n\nHad the musical component been operating on the day that we visited, it might have been worth the $8 each that we paid to see the armory, but without any music, the exhibit was disappointing. (Perhaps someone could have played music using an iPod.)"},{"review":"The Park Avenue Armory is so incredible - a stunning building with a stunning series of shows and exhibitions. There seems to always be a reason to go there - whether it's the Winter Antiques Show or any one of their 'staged' spectacles - the performance with the piano in the water in the darkened field house was a highlight of this season for me. \n\nJoin the Armory, get the mailings, stay up on what's coming and you'll find yourself there on a regular basis - and the better for it.\n"},{"review":"This was our second trip to NYC and second trip to the Park Avenue Armory. I don't know what they show outside of the summer season, but their summer art installation is a MUST for any serious art lovers. The venue itself is extraordinary and worth a visit alone, but the curators of the sumer exhibition need serious congratulating as the choice and vision for the space is outstanding. \n\nYou need to allow yourself time to adjust to the exhibitions as they are experiential rather than passive. At the moment, Philippe Pareno's H {N)Y P N(Y} OSIS is on and is a trippy multi-media experience replete with unexpected (and somewhat disturbing) live action performers grace a Tino Sehgal.

I love NYC but this made me fall in love with the city in an entirely different way. The dedicated bike track is fantastic as you are able to bypass the footpaths and large crowds. Obviously some parts of the greenway are congested but it generally was quite clear. Take a camera as you can stop and get some fabulous pics of the city. I definitely will be doing it again. \nThe ride is generally easy, there are some hills on the East side. I think the West Side track is much nicer than the East so next time we might just ride down and back up the west side of the Greenway. Tip- Chelsea market is a great spot to stop for lunch"},{"review":"If you think about riding a bike in New York than not only consider a tour in Central Park.\nThis tour around Manhattan is just fantastic and has so much to offer.

But it's our favorite. We take our bikes on the ferry from New Jersey. The pathway itself runs from Battery Park. All the way up the Hudson River to the GW Bridge, there is no traffic and it's usually cooler by the river with amazing views of both sides, places to stop and rest even picnic. About 6 miles each way great for an afternoon, and a spectacular view of the city on the way home on the ferry. It is 10 bucks to take you bike on the ferry. You will not regret this adventure!."},{"review":"I grew up in NY and left thirty years ago--I was amazed to come back to bike paths that rivaled Amsterdam.

Artwork, lawns, bike\/walking path that starts in Battery Park and goes clear up the west side of Manhattan. The Hudson on your left, lawns and new trees on your right. You can stop off a Chelsae Pier, or see the Docked Aircraft Carrier Intrepid. Bridges, Stone Paths, Ornate Benches all make this a far better walk than Broadway if you are trying to unwind. Take out the crowds and endless vendors, or use the Citibikes here where it is safe and makes a lot more sense."},{"review":"I have been biking the Greenway for several years and what I like is that you can bike down to the Financial District and all the way up to Inwood Hill Park which anyone rarely bikes to. The bike path is really nice and as long as everyone obeys the signs, it is an enjoyable way to see NYC. The most exciting and crowded part is from the Financial District to the upper west side, or at least the tennis courts. The Financial District is the busiest as the path seems to narrow, but that is because there are more joggers, runners, roller blades, and tourists. And later morning all the way to early evening is crowded. If you want to beat the crowds, then earlier in the morning. It is quite peaceful. Once you get tourists walking all over the path, not knowing which direction to walk and not looking both ways before crossing has made for many harrowing experiences between pedestrians and bikers. The quietest section is north of the tennis courts or north of 125th street. Many people don't realize there is a light house under the GW Bridge, and this path will take you there. Riding up to the Cloisters is even quieter because most cyclists don't want to bike up the enormous hill. Anywhere you go though, there are sights to see, places to sit, have a picnic, and enjoy the Hudson River."},{"review":"The Manhattan Waterfront Greenway is a system of bike paths which encircles the island off\nManhattan. I had the opportunity to bike along the Hudson River side for about six or seven miles with a bicycle that was provided free by my Chelsea area hotel. What a wonderful way to experience New York City. I rode by the Chelsea Piers sports and activity complex, the Heliport where a helicopter was landing as I approached, the Intrepid air craft carrier museum, Riverside Park, and much more. There are great views of the river, the Statue of Liberty, the NYC skyline. There is only bicycle, skateboard and pedestrian traffic on the greenway, allowing you to enjoy the scenery without having to worry all the time about cars, and there are plenty of parks to stop and relax and picnic in all along the way. A wonderful outing to see the city from a different perspective."},{"review":"This is a dedicated bike path but you will find that some people walk and run here. There is also a parallel foot path along the way that will join the bike path at times. Started at Pier 1 Café around W 70th St. and rode down past Chelsea pier and into the Tribeca\/ Financial area where a sign was posted that said the path was closed and detouring to the right. Not sure of total distance but the scenery and path were well maintained and there were many dedicated bike traffic lights letting you know when it was safe to cross the street.

When you get off the tram, you do have a 15 minute-or-so walk to the park (although you can also take a bus from the tram). It is very clearly marked and there is an information kiosk near the tram.

Take the aerial tram from 59th street for just a swipe of your metro card to make an especially dramatic arrival on Roosevelt Island. It is easy to ignore the fact that this is an important memorial to FDR as the sculpture of his head only, recessed into a niche, just doesnt hold its own against the surrounding sights.

I guess I am just so used to paying high prices for everything since I live in New York! We went in November, so did not have to contend with heat. I agree directions to here a difficult, but here is how we did it. It took us about 15 minutes from the High Street stop on the A\/C. From the subway stop, go north on Cadman Plaza East. Turn Right on Prospect Street. Turn Right on Pearl Street and Left on Sands Street. Follow Sands street until it ends at Navy Street. There will be a big open gate. Follow the road inside, past the security guard who will check your id. The old building is straight ahead a bit to the right.\n\nThe tour was about 45 minutes and gave us a lot of whiskey history as well as information about the origin of Kings County and what makes them different from large scale distillers. (Keep an ear for the discussion on head,heart, tail). For a Brooklynite, this was fascinating. If you like quirky little adventures off the beaten path, I think this would be a perfect stop.\n\nI have been on a lot of distillery\/brewery\/winery tours and the sampling amounts are always different. I enjoyed just a taste of the three spirits; bourbon, moonshine, chocolate moonshine. Yes, the prices are steep, but this is what you would expect for a small batch artesian operation. (And yes, I am so numb to inflated prices, I have paid $5 for a pack of English muffins!)\n\nI personally enjoyed my Saturday adventure to Kings County Distillery and recommend the tour. This is a good little add on if you plan on exploring the adjacent neighborhood of Dumbo."},{"review":"Prior to our visit to Brooklyn we had followed, with interest, the Sky TV programme 'Moonshiners'. We were keen to learn more about the people carrying the tradition beyond prohibition to produce legal liquer.\n\nWe were delighted to discover that Kings County Distillery were doing just that, and that tours were available on Saturday afternoons during the time of our stay in Brooklyn.\n\nWe downloaded the details, but soon found that this place was not as easy to locate as suggested - even the locals couldn't help! It seemed a VERY long walk from the nearest subway station in the baking heat of a July afternoon, but we assumed that we would gain some respite once at our destination from the air conditioning inside the Boatyard building. \n\nWRONG - there is no air conditioning. The building is very basic as is the production process - no hi-tech mass production here. For the benefit of visitors with mobility problems it should be noted that there are several sets of stairs to climb and very limited seating available once reaching the top. As far as I am aware, there is not a lift.\n\nMy first impression was that the building was dirty. My second impression was that we were robbed............we were aware that a tour is $8 each, but didn't expect that our 8 year old son would also be charged $8. He was not at all interested in a tour, but had to tag along with us obviously. Incidentally, the $8 includes barely more than a thimble full 'taster' in the gift shop at the end of the tour - clearly not appropriate (or legal) for an 8 year old! However, having walked so far to get there, we paid up, and the tour began.\n\nThe tour lasted approx 45 minutes, and involved lengthy periods of standing, sometimes outside in the baking sun of the 'garden', much stair climbing, and a great deal of talk from the guide. In my opinion he was on an ego trip - his commentary was repetative and boastful. Our fellow visitors appeared bored as there was little to see (unless you like a patch of earth, 5 stills and a room full of small barrels), I suspect that what the majority of us wanted to see was a chair to sit on!\n\nOf course, the tour concludes in the gift shop where the 'taster' is offered (lemonade alternative\/addition) and one feels slightly pressured to buy. However, this is rather expensive and I saw few people make a purchase. We did buy though, as we wanted to purchase gifts. We paid $80 for 2 smallish bottles of bourbon, and $70 for a boxed set of 3 smaller bottles.\n\nThankfully, as we reached the main road, we found a bus stop and were able to use our Metro card to get back to the hotel again, saving us the long walk back to the subway.\n\nWould I go again.....nope!"},{"review":"We read about the Kings County Distillery on the way to NYC. It looked interesting, so we took the Subway from Rockefeller Center into Brooklyn. We walked around the artsy area and then headed toward the old Navy Yard to visit Kings County Distillery. It is a short walk from the York Street Subway. We entered through the main gates at the Navy Yard. The tour was very informative. David (our tour guide) did a wonderful job explaining the history of the area, prohibition and the details of making bourbon. It was a fun afternoon and we enjoyed sampling the bourbon after the tour. We will definitely visit again in the future to see how they are doing.

This flight was completely overbooked. As there were significant issues with seating and really poor organisation- our flight departure time was missed. At JFK airport this causes real problems. We ended up being stuck in the plane for 5 hours before we even went anywhere. Due to that delay we missed our connecting flight to Perth and had to spend a night in Abu Dhabi. In the end Etihad provided a hotel but not before we waited at a transfer desk for 2 more hours! The next day they provided a new flight to Australia only it was to Melbourne (4 hours further away from our destination). We finally arrived in Melbourne only to be delayed 2 hours by Qantas. When we finally arrived in Perth 3 days later, our luggage was lost. My son did not receive his bag for 3 days. \n\nWe sent the airline a complaint with a lot more detail and than written here and they have never even bothered to respond.\n\nReally bad performance and quite surprised given what others have said.

With a mix of classic and modern works, paintings to sculptures to experimental, Sperone has a lot of everything for everyone. \n\nIf there was any downside of the gallery, it would be that the staff isn't always that forth coming to engage- though that unfortunately is not an unfamiliar pretentiousness in these scenes. \n\nBut if you can get past that, its great to visit on a solo run and even better to share with a group or your significant other!\n\n4 stars for the art they feature!"},{"review":"We visited the New Gallery, only to be told that the exhibition was in transition, so there was little to see.\nThe wonderfully helpful woman suggested we take in the exhibition at Sperone Westwater, a few blocks along Bowery Street. Thank heavens we did.\nThe Gallery has a black facia, and little obvious branding - keep your eyes open. \nWe entered, cash in hand, to be told it is all free. And it was all fantastic!\nExhibitions change, so perhaps we were especially lucky - the one we saw featured sculpture \"from 3000BC to last week.\" It was particularly moving to see the ancient and the modern side by side - brilliant curation.\nI still haven't worked out whether this is a commercial gallery or a public gallery - either way, I highly recommend it was a destination for art lovers with an hour up their sleeve in New york City."}]},{"nearBy":["East Village","New Museum","Bowery"]}]},{"DiMennaChildren'sHistoryMuseum.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"170 Central Park West","postalCode":"10024","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" (2212) 873-3400"},{"reviews":[{"review":"My 11-year-old son and I recently met a girlfriend and her 6-year-old daughter here and I was very happy that the museum held both of the children's attention for several hours.

Very interesting exhibit, nicely done"},{"review":"The Cloisters is a beautiful retreat on the northern end of Manhattan, filled with wonderful medieval European artwork, stained glass, architecture and furniture. While the paintings and tapestries are the draw, the building itself is magnificent, incorporating portions of actual French and Spanish cloisters from the Middle Ages. Robert Campin\u2019s Mérode Altarpiece Triptych is justifiably considered a masterpiece, but we were also quite captivated by a 13th century Spanish wood panel painting with fantastically stylized figures. The Gothic Chapel and Langon Chapel retain an aura of pious reflection, despite being part of the city\u2019s largest museum. It would be worthwhile to visit simply to enjoy the breathtaking setting on the Hudson River and the delightful herb garden within the Bonnefont cloister. We spent plenty of time just reflecting in the garden, before dipping into the treasury to check out the collection of illuminated manuscripts, some nearly thousand-year-old jewellery, combs and chalices, along with a well-preserved set of playing cards that is only 550 years old."},{"review":"My 6 year-old daughter read \"Blizzard of the Blue Moon\" and was eager to visit the place where the \"unicorn rugs hang on the walls\" (ie: The Unicorn Tapestries at The Cloisters)! We traveled from Baltimore for this express purpose. The Cloisters is a lovely museum, and she was awed by the unicorns. The rest of the museum is a bit 'heavy' for children, but no matter as the unicorns were our focus. We took the A train from Penn Station to 190th and the walk through the park was beautiful, despite the misty, gloomy weather. Even saw cops on horseback. Would love to spend more time in Ft Tryon park next time! It's a work of art itself! The whole \"pay what you wish\" still dumbfounds me, but we paid the suggested entrance fee."},{"review":"The best time to do the long ride to the Cloisters from mid Manhattan is a Sunday afternoon. A wonderful respite from midtown this is a place to stop and smell the roses. Art includes paintings, sculpture tapestry, (the Unicorns), and the structure itself. A castle on the Hudson with lovely views. North of the Washington bridge so not walkable from midtown or the Met Museum. The garden area is perfect for just relaxing and catching your breath.

The result is that a noticeable number of kids who visit regularly seem immune to the concept of civil behavior. Even when directly told by an adult not to cut, they give blank stares and ignore the admonition. For parents interested in raising considerate and responsive kids, this playground is counter-productive. This problem could easily be remedied by making a single, narrow entry to the top of the slide, instead of the wide-open, multi-approach scrum, where the quick and ill-mannered consistently push ahead of all others."},{"review":"We went to see the Balto Sculpture and stopped in this playground on the way out.

Conveniently located a hop and a skip away from the Children's Zoo at 67th & Fifth Avenue, this playground's main claim to fame is that it contains what just may be the city's best loved sliding board. While an impressive 45 foot swooping curve of granite, it is fast and fun enough for pre-teens while not being so steep as to be unsafe for the daring 2 year old. WARNING: Your child will want to stay all day.\n\nOne of the twins asked me why many of the kids were sliding on pieces of cardboard. I told her to try it and let me know. The answer is SPEED, but you have to bring or find your own piece of cardboard. The kids jump off the slide quite giddy and can't wait to run back up to do it again (and again and again). The line is long at the top, but the kids feel it's worth wait (or cut in line... parental supervision at the top advised). Sure there are rustic elements, gazebo, picnic benches, water fountains and wading streams, but the kids will ask to go back for the slide.\n\nIf you are lucky, there will be a juggler outside the playground. He has been there for YEARS. He is one of the best of the busters. He does comedy and recites lovely poetry while juggling all manner of things, many of which are quite sharp. I once saw him juggle a 16 lb. bowling ball, an axe, and some other stuff including an apple which he ate while he juggled it. \n\nBetween the Children's Zoo, playground, juggler, face painters and a bag lunch, you could spend the whole day here. If like me you spring for a zoo membership (gets you through express line into all the city's zoos and aquarium for a year) the whole afternoon could cost you next to nothing but the kids will remember it forever."},{"review":"Se siete nei paraggi e volete fare una pausa divertenete coi vostri bimbi, provate il mega scivolo, divertimento assicurato anche per mamma e papà."},{"review":"I was inspired to seek out the playground by a Time Out New York review of great NYC parks for kids which sold it as a great little park with landscaping in keeping with the traditions of Central Park itself.

That said, I had never gone inside of the building.until this week. Shame on me. It was an exhilarating experience. Should you be visiting New York and particularly Greenwich Village you owe it to yourself to go inside and walk through the building, and the stairwell.

There is plenty of history about this building and the library will provide you with the details."},{"review":"Shortly after this courthouse built in a Victorian German Gothic style opened a group of architects voted it one of the most beautiful buildings in the country. A women's house of detention stood behind the courthouse where the community garden is today. Friends and lovers of inmates used to stand on Greenwich Avenue and shout up to their loved ones. This used to go on day and night and may have been amusing if you didn't live there or an irritation if you did. Back in the 1960's the detention house was torn down and the locals were able to get control of the land and turn it into a community garden which is worth the donation to visit. The courthouse was going to be torn down but the community along with some literary figures including the poet Marianne Moore and other well known people managed to save the building and have it turned into a library which has become a beloved resource for the area. The building is wonderful and is well worth a visit because of it's style and architectural features. The stairway is in the clock tower and be sure to visit the basement. The building has been undergoing years of restoration but now the scaffolding is almost all gone (some work on the entrance is still going on) and the building can be seen at its gothic best.

The local railway workers perceived them as a threat to their livelihood & there was undisguised discrimination. In 1882, Chinese were not allowed to migrate to USA. may of these railway workers who built the us railroads , could not be reunited with their families & Chinatown became bachelorland.

How their dreams were not what they thought, how they suffered discrimination, at the hands of others. And how they became successful in their chosen fields. Combined with Ellis Island we have made some interesting studies, on immigration to the States. The museum is small, but well informed, staff will answer your questions,if required. This place is, a place of information and you have to have an interest to visit, it's not a museum of Chinese past. Great place, good for Chinese students and families to look at the heritage of past,to the States."},{"review":"This is a fairly comprehensive introduction to the subject. A well-maintained and nice property with quite a bit of information. If you spend the time to carefully read all the displays, you will gain a very good perspective on the experience of Chinese in America.

So I did not miss this one either.

What happened to them when they were shipped to America to help built the railway linking East and West coast. How they were treated during WWII, Korean war and cold war.

La pellicola West Side Story fu aspramente contestata perchè ritenuta troppo smielata in confronto alla realtà, dove irlandesi e portoricani insieme con la mafia italiana, hanno creato faide di una violenza comparabile solamente con quella dei Five Points nel secolo precedente; ma come i Five Points, e forse anche di più, da questo disordine è nata l'America, con tutte le sue contraddizioni, e dalle risse di strada è nata l'odierna New York. L'alto grado di tolleranza, democrazia, e civiltà di questa città si sono evolute attraverso decenni di scontri, omicidi, guerre tra razze.

First, it will be a bit less expensive, but not much. An 8x12x16 inch box will run you approximately $80 to send between the US and the UK. You will wait in line (queue) about 1 hour before seeing a counter person. You will need to fill out a customs declaration form (very complex and not printed with foreign addresses in mind). You will then have foreign duty charges applied when the package arrives in the destination country (our charges were 30 pounds duty charges). When added to the initial shipping charge, this is very close to paying for an additional suitcase to take on your flight OR close to paying an 'excess baggage' fee - in either case having your items with you on arrival. And then there is the tracking problem. There is no international tracking available when using the US Postal Service. And in the UK, a subcontracting parcel delivery service actually handles the delivery to your door - not the Royal Mail. This adds an additional layer of bureaucracy (and finger-pointing or shoulder shrugging if things go wrong or the package gets lost somewhere). Oh, and by the way, while \"Registered Mail\" and \"Certified Mail\" work very well within the US to keep track of letters and parcels, they do not work and are not recognized by overseas mail services such as Royal Mail. My advice? Your best option is to buy an additional bag, or pay an 'excess' charge if you must.

The man at the desk was really nice and helpful giving us the best price for tickets for the show we wanted to see, $115 each. The tickets had to be picked up later which we did they were in a white envelope. It was not until we arrived back at our hotel THE ROW, which was brilliant, that we opened the envelope and looked at the tickets the face value of the seats were $87 so we had paid a commission of $28 each, disgusting. The show 'Kinky Boots' was fantastic and having enjoyed it so much we decided to see another show but this time bought the tickets from the theatre. We chose 'It should have been you' and paid $35 for row C in the stalls the seats were at the side but the view was perfect and this time I actually had room to cross my legs, the show was funny and surprising I would certainly recommend it. Please be careful when buying your theatre tickets, the booths in Times Square sell half price best seats tickets for on the day shows (long queues), if you want to buy in advance I would strongly advise going to the theatre to get your tickets.

The play is a window on average America dealing with life, adjusting to difficult changes with a sense of humour, getting by in a less than optimal set of circumstances but dealing with it all-realisticly, believably and with surprising pathos. Wouldn't expect less from Collette. She is a star, as is Michael C. Hall 'Dexter' and Marisa Tomai and Tracy Letts.

The house sits atop a hill. It\u2019s an old house, built in 1906. It\u2019s a house with character, not without flaws here and there. Within its walls is a The first floor of Vytlacil\u2019s Late Victorian farmhouse contains the office, art supply store, an extensive art library, iMac computer with Photoshop, Wi-Fi, and the three resident studio spaces. The second floor is where the kitchen, shared bathroom, and three good size individual bedrooms. Washer and dryer in the basement.\n\n\nHow is the staff? The staff at Vyt (short for Vytlacil because it\u2019s so hard to pronounce) are beyond excellent. They are welcoming, friendly, happy, easy-going, intelligent, and supportive. They go out of their way to make your stay not only comfortable but also enjoyable. If you need anything, you just have to ask. If you want great conversation, all you have to do is just start talking.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s Vyt like? I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I did think that one month was a long time; it\u2019s not. To put it very simply, the environment at Vyt is conducive to creativity. And, this probably goes without saying, you get out of it what you put into it.\n\nWhere is Vyt located? It\u2019s in the small hamlet of Sparkill, NY. Sparkill is about an hour by bus from The Port Authority Bus Station. You can catch the bus into Manhattan at the town square, which is a short (less than 10 minutes) walk from Vyt. The cost for a round trip is approx. 15 bucks plus a bit of change. The Vyt van goes into Manhattan every Wed. You can catch a ride and a ride back later in the evening at no cost.\n\nEating. Totally relaxed. Lunch is ordered for you every day, but you\u2019re on your own for breakfast and dinner i.e. cook it yourself. Once a week or so one of the staff will take you grocery shopping. For me, I find this ideal.\n\nWhere can you get art supplies? The Vyt store is pretty small. However, you can order supplies from The League in Manhattan or order and have shipped from a supplier of your choice. I recommend going into the city to Lee\u2019s Art Supply located directly across from The Art Students League on 57th Street. Good prices.\n\n[--]"}]},{"nearBy":["Museum of Arts and Design","New York City Center Theater","Columbus Circle"]}]},{"Specialty&GiftShops(526).html":[{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"ImaginationPlayground.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"165 John Street","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"It's located in the busy area of the financial district, so air was filled with lots of exhausts, it was especially notisable in the hot day. \nIt's not your average playground, but there are so many great playgrounds in parks.

As an extra bonus, I bumped into Al Lewis (Grandpa Munster) as he was coming out of an apartment building.\nThis time, on our 10th visit to NYC, we decided to spend the morning on the island so we took the F train from 42nd Street\/Bryant Park (only a few minutes by subway to the island) and then walked south along the river. We quickly reached the sky tram and then continued walking to the Four Freedoms Park. There's a lot of construction going on nearby but the whole area will look very attractive in the future. The views across the river are spectacular and, at one point. a good photo opportunity emerges where the Empire State, Chrysler and United Nations buildings are aligned. The photo can be framed by trees if it is taken from the elevated path which can be accessed by steps at one end or a ramp at the other. We strolled back and stopped for a very enjoyable lunch at an outside table in a park setting at the River Walk Bar and Grill near the sky tram. Later, the tram took us over the river to the scarily expensive antique, lighting and furniture shops at the East end of 59th street.

Two of the exhibitions, \"Superheroes in Gotham\" and \"Holiday Express: Toys and Trains from the Jerni Collection\" sound like they might be suitable to bring our 5 - 8 year old grandchildren on a return visit. The train display was beautiful but was a window display not larger than maybe 20 feet x 20 feet viewable through two windows. There were a number of overhead trains running on suspended track in adjoining hallways. The antique toys were displayed each in a small boxed area on a glass wall. I think most young children might be engaged for maybe 10 minutes. Though our grandchildren are Superhero fans, the \"Superheroes in Gotham\" are static displays of the original Superman, Batman, et al with placards of their history and a list of powers each possessed, not an exhibit for young children. I am not criticizing either display, but I think if you bring youngsters you will be next door at the Museum of Natural History in short order. \nThe artwork in the other exhibits was very nicely displayed and the film \"New York Story\" shown in a very comfortable theatre was great! Don't miss the multimedia displays in the main lobby area, they contain a wealth of information of the displayed items."},{"review":"Went back to the New York Historical Society Museum again this weekend for the Superheroes in Gotham exhibition.

I've never seen such 'overmanning' at an attraction in all my years of travelling; there was even 3 of them taking the hats and coats.. This place needs a complete overhaul of its business practices. We took our 7 year old granddaughter here one rainy day in October, and found the place just full of 'Po Faced' security guards, all standing about doing nothing, until one of the 'punters' gives them a reason to justify their existence: my little orange stick-on badge had slipped off my chest slightly, whereupon some 'badged flunky 'in a cheap suit seizes upon the opportunity to let me know he 'was doing his job'. \" Excuse me,Sir, but I need to see your authorisation to be here\".. or words to that effect. None of these people offered any practical help or advice; as I witnessed several people, who could have benefitted from some help, but not one of these 'security people' offered any assistance. They obviously think that helping the customers was 'outside of their remit'. We rather fancied a snack and a coffee, but the 'restaurant' was only offering 'full service' lunch; not what you want at a museum. A museum that didn't have much to offer, considering how much we paid to get into it. If you have kids to entertain, give it a miss, and go to The Staten Island Children's Museum at Snug Harbour. Great fun and not a 'cheap suit with a badge ' in sight."},{"review":"Information on the history of New York City was sparse and poorly organized. Most of the museum was given over to oddities such as the Bat Mobile, old toys, and other disjointed displays. The 18-minute film was decent but certainly not worth the admission. The museum has one of the most outstanding collections of paintings by Thomas Cole, Asher Durand, and other Hudson River School artists as well as Audubon's \"Birds of America\" originals, but none was on display. In the weeks prior to my visit I had inquired about paintings now on display, given that the Luce Center (on the fourth floor where the paintings apparently were displayed) was closed. I sent two emails and received no replies. I called and was told that artwork had been moved to other locations in the museum (I was particularly interested in viewing Thomas Cole's \"Course of Empire\"). However, when I got to the museum I was told that \"Course of Empire\" was at the Louvre, but that it would be back in 2016. I told the attendant I wasn't planning on staying that long! No other paintings were on display. The best thing about this \"museum\" was the statue of Abraham Lincoln outside on the front steps. I wouldn't bother with this place unless you have absolutely nothing else to do."},{"review":"I don't get it. In Chicago the Historical Society Museum is one of the best. So I expected this museum to be equal.\n I had a bad feeling when I walked into the lobby and saw the Batmobile displayed. Turned out it was part of an exhibition on Super Heroes in Gotham. I spent about 3 minutes there. Comic book stuff.\n Nothing seemed to link. There was a fairly good art exhibition of Picasso pieces and artists who inspired Picasso. But what did any of that have to do with the history of NY?\n The introductory movie was good but nothing followed up among the exhibits. The permanent collection on the 4th floor was closed for remodeling so maybe we missed the good stuff. \n Where was the Erie Canal? What about Tamanny Hall? TheCivil War riots? Baseball? \n But from what I saw...don't bother."},{"review":"Charming decor, different, and very good food! I've only been for lunch, never disappointing!

The building has been empty for many years. It was chartered in 1827 as a place devoted to providing medical services to the 'worthy poor' and the building was put up in 1831. Edgar Allan Poe was treated here for a head cold a few years later. It is a three sided building of red brick standing alone on its own little triangle. It is probably the only three sided building in the world that has one side standing on two streets (on this side Grove Street melds into Christopher Street) and the other two sides are both on Waverly Place (right where the building stands Waverly Place splits off heading along one side of the building while the original Waverly Place continues on a bit along the third side of the building to Grove Street where that bit of Waverly Place ends.

A few years later the writer George Whitmore who had AIDS sued because he was refused treatment and won. At that point the Archdiocese forced the tenants out and closed the building. Some years later the building was sold to a man who liked buying historic buildings. Because of the building's deed that it can only be used as a medical clinic for the 'worthy poor' the building has remained empty.

Making reservations- worth it. \nThe staff's dedication to the spirit and practices of Donald Judd is extraordinary. The dusty, pithy, remarkable Soho of the '70s lives on in this time capsule. An Installation with stairs, it is a very moving experience within The Tenement Museum genre.Judd Museum provides a beautifully detailed, intimate amount of time. My understanding and appreciation for this type of Art have increased a great deal, having visited."},{"review":"The other reviewer did a wonderful job on specifics of the tour of Judd's NYC studio and home. We were there in March and all bags, no matter the size were required to be checked along with all coats. I made my reservation about a month in advance. There were 7 of us on the tour.\n\nJudd's studio\/home is a 5 story single occupied cast iron building in the heart of SOHO. Judd along with other artists pioneered that area in the late 60s, early 70s and the tour gives you a glimpse into that era. The light into the building is beautiful with enormous windows. The higher floors have more alterations by Judd. \n\nIf you are big fans of Judd, you will enjoy it. It's also interesting to see a single occupied building of that size in SOHO. The guide was an artist who could answer questions about Judd, his art, the art displayed in his home (mostly friends like Stella, Oldenburg, Flavin), SOHO architecture and the particular building.\n\nWe live in the area and have been in many lofts, some well-known artists, so perhaps we are jaded but we did find it tedious that the staff was instructed to treat everything as very precious\/important and we've never been to a tour that had so many instructions and rules. Perhaps they've had some problems? The other thing is they give more than ample time to view Judd's carefully but sparsely curated studio, living area, dining area, bedroom area. You cannot leave the group so be prepared to spend some time. However if you are a big fan, you will probably appreciate the slower pace and time to digest the spaces and art."},{"review":"In 1968, a few years after he abandoned easel painting, the sculptor Donald Judd (1928-1994) bought an abandoned textile factory building in what is now called SoHo, New York City. This \"Cast Iron\"-facade building was recently restored by his charitable foundation, and opened for a limited number of guided tours. They had to auction a number of his sculptures to raise the money for the refurbishment of his buildings in New York and in Marfa, Texas.\n\nYou have to order dated and timed tickets WELL in advance, using the foundation's website: www.juddfoundation.org\/ . I had to wait about six weeks, right after they started the tours. In August, 2013, it looks to me like the wait is now about three months. The size of the tours is limited to eight guests, and the 90-minute tours are at 1, 3, and 5PM on three days a week. The entrance is just around the corner from 101 Spring Street, on Mercer Street. (That's because there is a Carl Andre stack-of-bricks precariously close to the Spring Street door. You can also see three Judd \"wall\" works through the large windows on the street.)\n\nLike other artist studios I've been to, you have to check any bag of modest size, and photography is prohibited. These rules are justified, because some of the alcoves and rooms you get to visit are tiny, and there's real danger of bumping into things that you're not allowed to touch. The Judd family's personal artifacts are all around, and they can't risk someone slipping something into a purse. They do have a checkroom, but luggage and strollers are not accommodated. Photography is prohibited. Please turn off your phone.\n\nIt's a fascinating tour. You have to wait your turn to squeeze into his study and the closets and bathrooms he added to the open floors of the factory building. Judd also collected the work of artists he admired, like John Chamberlain and Dan Flavin, so you'll see their work after you climb the long wooden staircases to five floors. (They do have an industrial elevator that can be run for those who can't climb the stairs.) African art that inspired Judd lines some the stairs, but our tour guide said that the provenance and authenticity of that work is questionable. You'll also see three works assembled by Judd that are unlike anything in museums: They have a rough, partially unfinished nature that disappeared when he started using professionalals to build his sculptures.\n\nIn his \"living room\", there is a massive aluminum box with open ends, reminiscent of Richard Serra, but with visible fasteners. The 1\" aluminum sheets are not polished, but show marks from the mill. In his bedroom there are two wall pieces that are roughly, almost crudely, hand-made by him. These show his transformation from painting to \"Specific Objects\", somewhere between painting and sculpture."},{"review":"Wer die Kunstwerke von Donald Judd kennt und mag, dem wird die Tour durch sein früheres Wohn- und Atelierhaus gefallen. Es ist erstaunlich wieviel von seinem ganz persönlichen Stil, der sich quer durch alle Räume zieht, in seinen Arbeiten stecken.

Shaded with trees that provide a respite from the sun, we strolled through here and just took in the environment. Two different street performers were putting on shows and were fabulous. Free photos of them, and then we posed with them. Larger than life statues of authors, poets, explorers, and famous people line the walkway. Follow it to the end and you'll end up at the Bethesda Fountain where a beautiful angel hovers over the fountain that gushes a magnifent waterfall.

There were statues of great authors and poets with small bits of info on them, arranged on each side of a path for a good stretch.

The planetarium has been a favorite of ours for over 50 years."},{"review":"NOTE: This review applies to the Rose Center for Earth and Space only; we did not view the rest of the Museum of Natural History.\n\nThis place was so bad that got our money back and left. As visitors to NY, a trip to the redesigned Hayden Planetarium and its shows was on the top of our \"Must Do\" list. What a disappointment! We expected a mixture of space-related informative mock-ups and reproductions with some informative and beautiful Hubble telescope images. \n\nWhat we got was an endless series of small photographs of some star or quasar or radio signal with a one or two line caption next to each. The captions contained very little information and were written at a very low level, presumably for children. The \"interactive\" space exhibit consisted of pushing a button to watch the image change. The whole Rose Center was boring and repetitive. If you ever read a book about space or visited a space museum before, you will not learn anything new here.\n\nThere was no mock-ups of a lunar lander or the mars rover. There was no interactive \"space shuttle pilot's chair\" where you could practice trying to dock to the space station such as we have seen in other space museums. There were no films about how astronomy or space flight or engineering are conducted. There were no provisions for adults who wanted to learn more about astronomy and space. No in-depth docent tours. No audio tours (although someone said that if you have a smartphone you can listen to some info but we don't have a smartphone). Meanwhile the museum was AWASH with screaming, running children. Apparently, this museum is a favorite destination for school field trips--keeps the kids cool and entertained for a couple of hours. \n\n\nAfter 20 minutes, we were so disappointed and frustrated and so sick of the piercing children's voices that we got our money back and left $22 each plus $4 for the Dark Space exhibit). If you want to visit a space museum, to the Smithsonian space museum in DC or MOSI in Tampa or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena or just about any place OTHER than the Rose Center for Earth and Space."},{"review":"Lots of interesting facts and things to see.

The pale was updated to the 21st century and everyone loves it. The stark outside is a bit foreboding but inside they have really gotten it correct.

Great place to take the kids."},{"review":"My wife and I had tickets to see some films and walk thru exhibits at the planetarium. As a native New Yorker I want to espouse all of her greatness but find that every time I go to this particular nyc attraction, I can't wait to get the hell out of the building. Thus I cannot say as most other reviewers seem to say, that this museum is anything but tired, poorly signed, and in dire need of redesign and updating. For one, the dioramas reflect an old premise that one must kill animals for display. The dioramas thus reflect to me, killed animals. They should be removed and redesigned. That is the old museum. The new planetarium offers more but is still missing something. It just seems to be adrift.Of course the entire place has many positive exhibits but too many are still dated. Again, better signage and direction and improved lighting would help immensely.\nThere are those movies available and walk thru exhibits which are well done for the most part but the entire museum cannot compare to the science museum in San fransisco.

Today it is called The Rose Center For Earth and Space (the Rose family of New York is responsible). You sit in a round theatre looking up at the heavens.

Some reviewers seem to have this confused. Then comes the Appellate Division, and then the highest court in New York, called the Court of Appeals. As far as I know, no other U. S. state, and certainly not the courts in the Federal system, names its courts like this. Yes the building is impressive, but I have been a lawyer for over 40 years and I know from experience that it is often true that in the halls of justice, the only justice is in the halls.

This is where you find Wall Street, The NY Stock Exchange building, the Charging Bull Statue, Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty bound ferries. You can easily spend a full day or more sightseeing in this historically important area of the city. \n\nOne of the things I like about Lower Manhattan are the views of the skyline, when taking ferries to Liberty Island. If you can take your eyes of the Statue of Liberty and look back towards Manhattan, you'll see a most impressive row of skyscrapers. Once you are far enough out into the Hudson, you can see Brooklyn Bridge as well. \n\nLater as you circle Liberty Island for passenger drop off, for a few moments, you will have opportunity to see the Statue of Liberty, Lower Manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge all in the same camera frame.

Make sure to \"step back\" after your visit to get the \"30,000 foot view\" of the skyscrapers! It is well worth it."},{"review":"Lower Manhattan is so expansive that you can't really do it in a single day, so I'll suggest three possible itineraries out of many 1) start at the very tip of Manhattan at Battery Park (many subways go there).Here you can take the famous Staten Island Ferry (free) or the one to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island (not free--don't miss Ellis Island, btw). Upon your return walk through Battery Park north along the Hudson. There's a wonderful river walk with places to eat and drink, and plenty to see. When you arrive at the NY Marina you can walk over to the 911 Memorial. After viewing the impressive reflecting pools (I myself find the 911 museum depressing) on a clear day go up to the Observatory at the top of the Freedom Tower (not cheap, but worth it--eat beforehand as the food up there is neither especially good, but is remarkably expensive). 2) Starting again from Battery Park, walk north, but this time hang a right onto Broadway. You'll immediately be at what was once the old Customs House (beautiful interior), but is not the National Museum of the American Indian. It's free and always has interesting exhibits. Continue up B'way until you've reached the approach to the WTC site. Go there or continue up to Wall Street, the Stock Exchange, etc. and two beautiful and historical churches on Broadway. You can then stroll up to historic NY City Hall and Tammany Hall. The City Hall park is quite lovely in good weather. 3) From Battery Park walk along the avenue furthest east, this one near the East River. There are lots of modern buildings, some public art, a memorial, etc. as you approach South Street Seaport.

Recommended."},{"review":"We saw Booty Candy here, to sum up this play with several different acts (some unrelated), it would be...\"If Seinfeld was gay and black living in New York City.\" The actors were all extremely talented, I give them credit for their performances. The writer used urban stereotypes for the laughs which worked very effectively. However, there were some acts that used shock value where I felt it wasn't necessary. It only distracted the audience from the story's message and the actors performances. Overall, I think the play was too long at over two hours, some of the transitions were awkward and had little value to add to the show. There were senior citizens in the audience and at over two hours, it was just too long, plain and simple. I felt that almost all the acts could have shaved off at least five minutes and still maintained their artistic integrity. Also, the theater itself was very hot and people were fanning themselves on this 90 degree hot and humid day in the city. There was one intermission. I don't think it will make it to Broadway since the subject matter is not main stream enough. I do hope that the African American community will support this play and others like it while having a good laugh."},{"review":"Words cannot describe this theater (small and intimate) and the play we saw.

Reminds me a bit of a roller rink without the boards\/walls. Yet very warm and charged with pending excitement. We saw a superb, moving musical called Fun Home which ended up winning a bunch of Tonys in 2015. I bawled like a baby. The singing was sublime.

It is the women (and this not a rant about women, but my descriptor as I saw no men past the ticket taker) working inside the theater...not a smile, a pleasant word, any kind of \"this place is great, this musical is great\". At one point an usher yelled out about turning off our cell phones prior to the start of the play, so people immediately pull out phones to turn off\/double check they are off so then she starts running at people demanding they put the phones away.

The museum looked great and we were excited to see this exhibit but we were kicked out and asked to leave!!! As we entered the museum there was only an open coat rack with a sign to hang at your own risk. So I held my cashmere topcoat on my arm and my husband his down Polo coat. As we entered the exhibit, the very young female guard immediately approached us and told us to \"hold our coats close to us so we don\u2019t damage any of the exhibits\". So we did just that. Evidently that was not good enough. Next thing I knew as we are walking through the exhibit, I hear her scolding someone loudly, (meant for me) then she came right up to me in my face and rudely and loudly (echoing) told me again to hold my coat close but this time she demonstrated how I should hold my coat. So now I rolled it in a ball and held it directly against my chest, it was ridiculous. Next thing I knew I heard her loudly (echoing) telling my husband to either leave his coat down stairs or leave the museum. We were extremely embarrassed and humiliated by this young woman. We went to the admissions desk and asked for our money back. We were given our money back without any questions. We assumed they knew until they asked what happened. I told them as calmly as I could and left. We won\u2019t be back regardless of the exhibit. Too bad and we live in the neighborhood."},{"review":"Major loan exhibitions of traditional, modern, and contemporary art from all over Asia.

Although I find spending time in this calm space perfect to view the beautiful bronzes from Tibet, the special exhibits are also appealing.

We went on the late morning of a nice Saturday. Getting there was straight forward. There are a few entrances to the park, but the main one is about 173rd street and Amsterdam avenue. Parking there is an absolute nightmare. Lots of apartment buildings in the area, so all of the street parking spots are gone. I would imagine this is the case throughout the day, no matter what time you decide to visit. We were lucky and park on a \"No Parking M-F\" street, after circling around for about 10 minutes or so. There were some events going on at the park on the day we went. I think it was sponsored by some insurance company who were promoting healthcare insurance options for NYC residents. The park itself has a few play areas as well as a large pool. We did not get to enjoy the pool, from from what it looks like, the pool seemed very well kept and clean. To get the high bridge itself, you go behind the park and down quite a few steep stairs. It took a while for people to get up and down, especially children and older people. The steps were quite steep, but had two 6x8' ish landings. I also saw that bikers took a path with a hill which makes you avoid the steps all together, but the path a good distance. At the bottom of the steps you walk a bit to the left and there you see the bridge. It was a beautiful site. High bridge tower um....towers over you. Lovely views of the east river both looking north and south. Looking north you can see the highways including 95, harlem river drive on the left and the Metro North railroad tracks to the right. There are fences along the full length of the bridge, which was god to see. Midway through the bridge it a sign that reads \"Welcome To..\" either Manhattan or The Bronx. The other side of the bridge of course was The Bronx which seemed to be like a small park, though I didn't explore too much on that side. I would highly recommend anyone to visit the park and the bridge. Breathtaking views and no fees. Public transportation might be a good option though due to the parking difficulty. I know the A, C, and 1 trains stop at 168th street at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, which is about 6-8 blocks from the entrance to the park. Lastly be careful, the park is lovely, but the area is not the best at times. I was pretty comfortable in the middle of the day on Saturday, surrounded by police (probably for the events taking place there that day), but I would not feel comfortable returning in the dark. I mean my camera screams \"steal me\", so as much as I would love to return for some evening photos of the beautiful city light reflecting off the water, I would very very hesitant. Having a finance who was raised in the area who also gave me a heads up on the dangers. Don't be deterred, just cautious and use a little common sense."},{"review":"Although the park itself has been open for some time, the actual high bridge has only recently been restored and reopened.

When visiting a museum we generally have our little ones bring their sketch pads and draw what they have seen. We did this and then discovered the joys of the rest of the facility. There is a sound and clay room. Kids sit at a bar and can make things of clay or explore sound. There is a paint\/craft room. Just walk in and you can paint at an easel (apron supplied), learn to braid a bracelet or make a bowtie, design your own ball gown. There are several rooms with activities for toddlers. Then we discovered the computer room. The activity of the day was learning computer animation. Our two had a lot of fun moving toy cars and cutout figures along a road taking snapshots with each move. At the end they had produced their own video. We stayed 4 hours.

There are different rooms for different activities and there is an ample supply of art material in each one. The kids (and grandparents) particularly liked the clay bar. Be sure to reserve a time as soon as you get to the museum. The artists gave individual instruction to each child. We took home some great pieces of art. Allow 3 hours to complete all the activities. The museum is geared to the 4 to 10 age group."},{"review":"Great way to spend a few or several hours on a Saturday encouraging art, creativity, and manual dexterity without messing up your own home! You and your children can get creative with various media and take it all home. Surprisingly therapeutic...I felt like my hidden inner artist had a huge outlet here! I was able to enjoy creating my own artwork, while my 3.5 year old son created his masterpieces nearby :)\n\nWhat a hidden gem in the West Village!\n\nHIGHLIGHT: \"The Clay Bar\" Such a cute concept where animals of your child's choice are made with the guidance of an instructor. So creative...my son LOVED helping to make his shark. Another childl made a frog, and the instructor (Seung) was SO gifted that she helped create a long projecting tongue with a fly on it!\n\nPros: \nLots of large windows\/sunlight in the wee arts & studio area!\nMy son loved playing at the various stations with play-doh, flubber, the magnetic tiles, foam building blocks, and the dot markers. \nI was able to watch nearby AND enjoy making my own artwork too.\nALL the supplies and materials are included with the admission price and you can make as many items as you'd like. \nWonderful to be creative and have all the supplies available without making a mess in your own home especially if you don't have room to store all the various media.\nChildren's Museum of Manhattan family members get a 50% discount\nPay as you can Thursdays!\nGreat way to spend a rainy day inside.\n\nCons: \nNone.\n\nHighly recommended!

Once we finished our group all split ways but we stayed to watch the final group of the day and talked with some of the cast members for a few hours -- the last group was 2 hours late!

There wasnt any food, so I'd suggest eating before you go and maybe have a light snack on you. Wasnt an issue for us."},{"review":"My friends and I all enjoyed this experience. I am not sure what to call it... a \"play\" is wrong, but it is more than \"scavenger hunt\". I won't give too much away for fear of spoiling the mystery.

The actors did a great job and the story was well done. We did a bunch of \"head slaps\" as we discussed the experience afterward. Realizing the hints and creativity were a fun discussion. A couple of the times the actors were so good in their part that we didn't realize they were part of the play.

Know that it was only the point of immigration in NY from 1892 to the early 1900's but this has become the repository for telling the story. You really need a lot of time to learn the story, however, so don't think this is a \"quick check it out\" kind of visit. Suggest you get your tickets online although in off months, the wait line isn't long. Know that you'll need to go through security like the airport so travel light. You get a free audio when you come into the building and this is a National Park so there are well-informed and friendly Park Rangers around to ask questions. Right now (Nov. 2015) a good part of their collection is NOT on exhibit as it was damaged during the hurricane but there is still lots to see. I suggest you not waste any time looking up ancestors that might have come through here - you can do that at home on your computer. However, if you have some specific questions, this might be a good place to talk to someone as you do your research. But give yourself lots of time - it takes a while to get there by public transportation which is VERY convenience - and then you take a ferry to here and the Statue of Liberty - and then, finally, you enter the building and can begin your pilgrimage to experience a bit of what it might have been like to have crossed that threshold with all your possessions in 1892."},{"review":"As part of the bat trip to Liberty island we stopped off on Ellis. A fascinating place where you will, if you choose to take the time, learn the history of not just New York but of the united states themselves I have been here before, but learnt even more on this visit. Great exhibition"},{"review":"Whilst I'm sure Ellis Island would have been a great tour if you have a long time to visit and look around the grounds and museum, we mainly came for the view of the Statue of Liberty and as we were short on time and found the best view of the Statue was from the boat we arrived at the island on, we left pretty quickly and didn't feel like we had missed out in doing so.\n\nThis felt like a bit of a tourist trap, and food\/drink were very expensive on the island. Maybe if we'd had more time we may have had a different experience. Overall I'd say still worth a visit to tick one off the bucket list but if you're here for the Statue of Liberty then you're better off just booking a boat tour (we found the Beast Speedboat Ride from Pier 83 to be fantastic)."},{"review":"I brought my wife to see Ellis Island but this time had a personal agenda. I was there to really see what my Grandfather saw when he migrated to the US from Italy in 1906 and learn about what they all went through.\n\nI highly recommend taking the audio tour, there's three different tours to take so allow ample time to see it all. Some parts were damaged from Hurricane Sandy which they're still working on fixing but all in all, the main parts of the tour are still intact. \n\nThere's a film that's played every 30 minutes and highly recommend watching it, it provides first had experiences and narratives about various journies to the US. \n\nOn the second floor, you can go and trace anyone you know who came through Ellis Island. I was able to see the date my grandfather arrived, the picture of the ship he was on and such...a personal history lesson in itself! \n\nIn the back, there's a wall of names that are inscribed of all those who came through Ellis Island and the city background provides a fantastic backdrop! \n\nA must see!!!!"},{"review":"We were in town for a class reunion and had a free afternoon \u2013 we decided to visit Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty with our 8 year old daughter. We had a noon boarding time (departed around 12:30) and arrived back to the dock around 4:30 (leaving from Liberty State Park in New Jersey). We definitely did this in a hurry, but you really do it in a little less time (we took a 30 minute ranger tour at Ellis) but more time would have been better. We were trying to beat the majority of rush hour traffic heading north. You depart the dock, stop at Ellis Island, re-board and stop at Liberty Island before heading back on the boat to the dock. You do not have the same boat the whole time and are not confined to a schedule. The boats leave every 30 minutes or so. You cannot go from Liberty Island back to Ellis Island - the trip is dock, Ellis, Liberty, dock. You can skip Ellis Island and continue on to Liberty Island if you wish; however, Ellis Island is amazing and I highly recommend stopping there even if just for 30 minutes. As we were limited on time, we decided to do the guided ranger tour, which took 30 minutes. I have done the audio tour in the past, and if you have an hour to spare, I HIGHLY recommend it. It was very informative. But back to the ranger tour\u2026 Our daughter loves getting Junior Ranger Patches, so on a whim I asked the ranger if they have one for Ellis Island, and they did!!! They provided us with the worksheet, and we learned just about everything we needed to complete it on the ranger tour. After we completed the form, we took it back to the ranger desk, they asked her a few questions, swore her in and gave her a sticker badge and her certificate. They will be mailing the actual patch to our home within the next few weeks.  FUN! I was worried the ranger tour would be crowded and difficult to hear, but the group was about 20 people and the ranger really projected well, so it was not an issue. People were really good about letting my daughter get up front, she was one of 3 kids on the tour. It is a fast tour, and certainly not as in depth as the audio tour, but it was a great overview and really held the attention of an 8yo better than the audio tour would have. She adores those rangers!!! Even if you didn\u2019t have relatives come through the island, it is a great historical stop. There are a lot of buildings on the island that are not open to the public, such as the hospitals and holding facilities (which my kiddo is convinced are haunted!!! \u2013 maybe they are\u2026.). There is a nice museum shop and a large gift shop for your shopping pleasure. There is also a nice café with reasonably priced food. You can also purchase food and snacks on the boats (chips, coffee, hot cocoa, soft drinks and hot dogs). There are also some souvenir options on the boat in case you forgot to get something in all your excitement over absorbing all this amazing history. My husband hadn\u2019t been to the statue since 2nd grade and had never visited Ellis Island. He really enjoyed it and thanked me for dragging him and my daughter out that day \u2013 as did she. Highly recommend this trip, even if you have to drag your family out there, they will thank you\u2026eventually. "},{"review":"I've visited Ellis Island twice with friends and family from out of town.

It has an ornately painted ceiling and rotunda. Also, I believe the court rooms there may have been used for the movie Good Fellas. Warning: you will have to pass through security to enter, and the guards do not allow picture-taking inside the building. \n\nFact about the Foley Square\/courthouse area you may find interesting: The whole area sits more or less directly on top of what was some of the worst parts of the old Five Points neighborhood (featured in Gangs of New York). The actual Five Points intersection is to the side and sort of behind the civil court building, at Worth and Baxter streets. The five points referred to five streets that previously intersected there. But much of it was taken over by the state and federal governments and bulldozed.

Thankfully I was a seat along from these otherwise I would have demanded another seat.\nThe stage door was chaotic, the crowd was massive so if you want to get to the front leave before or after curtain call!

We were told to give a donation and like many tourists we were berated loudly by a church worker in front of everyone for giving less then $10. A group of Asian tourists were screamed at and told to go to the end of the line while church staff laughed at them. I quickly questioned the type of church that demands a charge and we were told that the \"donation\" is for the performance and beautiful church views that would be worth it. We were then given the worst seats in the church and pushed around like cattle by church employees. I say employees because this church like many others in Harlem is making a fortune scamming tourists and treats everyone terribly including regular church attendees. \n\nThe service was terrible and I don't think many tourists really noticed it because they saw the staff sway around and sing off key in white robes and I imagined that it fulfilled something they hoped for which made them accept the poor treatment. We decided to leave because it was not worth it. I quickly found the terrible man at the front who promised a great show like this church is some new type of Apollo. I asked for a refund and he said\" we cant do that, I have never heard someone ask for a refund of a donation\". I replied, \" I have never heard of a church demand an entrance fee, call it a donation and then provide such a horrible worship service. He said that money was going to fix the church. Everyone in the community knows this is a lie. Some of the money is divided by staff while a small portion goes to the church and the smallest percentage goes to the regular patrons of the church. \n\nI understand the desire to experience gospel in Harlem but explore churches in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx where they are not scamming people. I heard Brooklyn tabernacle provides good worship gospel service.\n\nDo not support these churches that are taking your money, providing bad service and not giving back to the community all in the name of God.\n\nEspecially, Memorial Baptist Church on 141 W 115th St, New York, NY . The worse church experience in my life. I never saw foreigners so eager to enter a place and then treated so poorly.\n\n\nThink about it. The oldest churches and temples in the world in many of your home countries do not charge. They open their doors to everyone with fairness and kindness.

My experience was terrible. The technician was not even qualified. I realized I should have just taken control of the situation and dried my own hair but for some reason I did not do that. Almost a month has gone by and I am still horrified at the experience and at the price. Go anywhere - Bergdorfs, Barneys, - anywhere but to Saks. They were empty and they were rude.

Furthermore, the item had subsequently sold out. After contacting customer services, I can only describe my experience as a huge waste of time and that the service from Saks representatives was extremely bland and unhelpful. They tried to say that all overseas customers are experiencing order problems (not exactly reassuring!), but after reading other reviews I think the stock record is inaccurate and orders are accepted when the item has aleady sold out. Either way, it is totally unacceptable! If the website is being run like this, then it reflects badly on Saks as a whole. Looking at other reviews, this is not an isolated incident.

It follows the Royal Shakespeare Company production with major actors brought from England to play with the Broadway supporting cast. The production is an extravaganza aimed to overshadow everything else going on at Broadway in the spring of 2015. Have they succeeded? To some extent yes but largely no. It is a spectacular performance in a historic Broadway theater. If you are first time in New York City or revisiting after many years this is the place, and the show to go and enjoy. If you are a regular follower of what is good at Broadway and in a contemporary theater, stay away. The play has so many platitudes, generally lack of drama and will bore you with rehearsing well known historical details. In contrary to other historical dramas ( e.g. Mary Stuart) it lacks relevance to contemporary life and has all poor elements of historical drama written for high school students audience. Yes, it has a charm of Royal Theater and, it is unfortunately as flat as written by an aspiring playwright.

(It's also a hidden New York gem for walkers.) Just get to Amsterdam and 165th and turn right, you'll take a short path through a wooded area (about 1\/4 mile) and then you'll see the bridge. On the far side you'll find a short ramp that gets you onto the High Bridge \u2014 you'll have to walk your bike down 4 steps. On the Bronx side, the ramp is on the left side.

Interesting, though, to see parts of NYC, that tourists usually don't"},{"review":"It's truly amazing to have this bridge open to the public after being closed for so many decades, but whether or not it's worth visiting may depend on how much time you're in the city. \n\nThe whole thing takes about 3 minutes to walk across -- so a few minutes across, a few minutes back, and a few minutes to linger, and unless you're staying in the depressingly located Howard Johnson's hotel almost under the bridge, it's likely going to take you a while to get to the bridge. \n\nSo if you're a tourist, with only a few days or a week in the city, visiting the bridge likely will be disappointing. It's nice, sure, but there are plenty of better places to visit during a short visit to the city. \n\nFor the local, though, High Bridge offers the chance to see a familiar city from an unfamiliar perspective. And if you already happen to be in the neighborhood, the bridge and the parks on its either end offer a nice respite from the city."},{"review":"I must tell you, it is not every day that you get to go over an Aqueduct Bridge that was built in the first half of the 1800s and was built in the same style as the Roman Aqueducts from over 2 millennia ago.

Its the only pedestrian bridge connecting two boroughs with awesome views. As a child i always wondered when it would ever open and when it finally did it opened all the memories of the past and bridge to the future. The bridge is located behind the pool area and a steep staircase down will lead you to it.

The nineteenth century span connects Washington Heights to the Bronx, with a recreation center and large rustic park on the Manhattan side. Originally built for an aqueduct carrying Croton river water to a growing and thirsty city, it is now part of New York's amazing collection of over 500 parks for public enrichment. It is not a destination for international tourists like Central Park or the Highline, but for city folks it's a nice excuse to explore our history.

IT is not your traditional massage.....but it stretches your entire body and I always have tight hip flexors......she worked wonders and I have been feeling the benefits to her massage still and I have been back home for two weeks now.

This was just the thing we needed after a long train ride and many miles walked around the city. Very accommodating and convenient location that made it easy to grab dinner and see a show during the same outing. Fern was very helpful and provided a therapeutic, restorative Thai massage that left us both relaxed and invigorated.

I have been dealing with hip and piriformis issues - pain created from cycling and inadequate stretching. I've just finished my third session and already I feel my body opening up. I can sit cross-legged for the first time in years without pain. In addition to her skills as a therapist, I can sense her kind nature and genuine concern for my health. I have not felt this good in a long time.\n\nIf you are in town after a long flight and feeling a little locked-up - definitely pay Fern a visit."},{"review":"Have been living in NYC for over a decade and tried multiple massage studios. Fern immediately made me feel comfortable. You get a clean, spacious and private room and a rejuvenating massage from an excellent massage therapist. You will walk out feeling much better.

ISAW is housed in a historic six-story limestone townhouse at 15 East 84th Street which was built in 1899 and which has been extensively transformed into a suite of offices, study rooms, galleries, and a library, with careful attention given to retaining as much of its original architectural detail as possible.\n\nFor people like myself who are not scholars, the two galleries on the first floor are a source of great pleasure. The current exhibit focuses on the 300 years of Egyptian history after the death of Alexander the Great and ending with the death of Cleopatra. Over the years I've seen at least six other exhibits including a fascinating story of the Copper Age in Israel.\n\nWhatever is on display, this is well worth stopping by either before or after immersion in the vastness of its much larger neighbor to the west."},{"review":"I've live in NYC my whole life but never went here.

The current exhibit on early maps was fascinating and guided by a young student whose breath of knowledge and delivery were excellent. The guided tours are only on Fridays at 6 PM and last about 45 minutes. I happen to love maps but even if you don't, this look into how mapping techniques developed over the years holds your attention. The exhibit space is not large, but each piece displayed is superb.

The concept of free admission and a free tour by an NYU professor who is expert in the subject matter of the then exhibits really appealed to us and our friends. The free guided tours still take place at 6 PM on Friday evenings. Other programs, including some fairly esoteric lectures on somewhat arcane historical topics take place on other evenings at 6 PM. Having a trained PhD professor take you around and describe the objects on display and the historical context surrounding them makes for a provocatively intellectual evening. I urge everyone to go, but especially those folks interested in ancient history. The current exhibit includes statuary from Eqypt during the Ptolomaic period. Sounds pretty dry, right?

It was a wonderful way to get away from the typical tourist traps in NYC. It was really small, but that meant there were only five people in our tour group.

His presentation was really interesting and funny in all the right places. The highlight of the tour was going into the basement where the gangsters used to meet.

It focuses on his activities and the artifacts that were discovered in this particular bar. It does not focus on famous gangsters or organized crime. You do get to visit one of the remaining bars in operation from the Prohibition era, walk into a previously booby-trapped, bomb-ladden bunker, and an opportunity to try Absynthe.

Its zip 10021 is synonymous with wealth and \u201Cblue blood\u201D. Things have changed slightly in the last decade, but the Upper East Side is still clean, conceited and very expensive.\n It came as an after-thought in the development of Manhattan: downtown being finally developed, the wealthy nouveau riches needed to move away from the crowds, first in country estates, then in mansions along Fifth Ave and finally, in apartment buildings when it became acceptable for the well-off to live in common places with other people. Starting from Midtown up, on the East side I would mention the United Nations building on First & 42nd (Johny Carson lived a couple of blocks from here with gorgeous views on the East River); shopping galore on Fifth Ave (separate review) and upscale shopping on Madison (prepare to spend, Ralph Loren being premier example), Rockefeller Center (separate review), Central Park from 59th Up and the Museum Mile along Fifth. The Frick collection (separate review) is housed in Henry Clay Frick's former mansion and Andrew Carnegie\u2019s palace is now the home of the Copper-Hewitt museum (separate review). The Metropolitan Museum of Art (separate review), of course is also near by on Fifth. Park Avenue is lined with huge imposing buildings hosting the old, established super-rich (some of the new wealth chose the West side or hip Soho and Tribeca). \n Restaurants offering exquisite food and service are abundant.

The ferry is located adjacent to the Staten Island Ferry Termilnal, just to its east, and for only $2 round trip you can visit this small island of greenery just off the southern tip of NYC. Board the ferry, and you're as good as there, the boat trip is all of five minutes! Caveat: it's only open until September 27; I am posting this a bit late! But there is art and photography to see, mini golf, great for the kiddies and free (donations appreciated), a ball field, various foods to enjoy, and several places to stroll. When your reviewer was there recently, it was a beautiful, sunny day, and you can easily explore the entire island in an hour or two. So: easily arrived, low cost, very close, things to see & do---what more could anyone ask?"},{"review":"A very short ferry ride from downtown Manhattan or Brooklyn will take you to this oasis in the Big City. Governor's Island is changing so rapidly, offering more activities, art, sport, ferry routes, etc. every season that it's best to Google what's happening when you choose to visit (esp. the ferry schedule). In warm weather there can be a long wait for the ferry boat, but believe me, it's well worth it. There are many historic buildings, bike routes, scheduled art shows, and much more awaiting you upon your arrival. Although food venues haven't yet caught up with other aspects of the growth of the island, they are available. Still, I'd pack a lunch and make a picnic as my first choice."}]},{"nearBy":["Staten Island Ferry","Jalopy Theatre Company","Ellis Island Immigration Museum"]}]},{"GolfCourses(3).html":[{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"Zipline&AerialAdventureParks(1).html":[{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"Cheim&Read.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"547 W. 25th St","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212\/242-7727"},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":["Gagosian Gallery","I Heart NY Photography - Tours","New York Art Tours"]}]},{"EverettChildren'sAdventureGarden.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"200th Street and Kazimiroff Blvd.","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 718-817-8700"},{"reviews":[{"review":"Even though my kids are now teenagers, we make point to visit every year especially during the train show.

Not only can you take this many cases but the guard will help you stow them in the luggage racks, so don't worry if you are loaded down. \n\nYou can access the Amtrak waiting room - with what seemed to be adequate seating, or wait around in a central area to watch when your train arrives and what platform you are leaving from. This may be a shock to some people but the same situation exists at Euston in London so we were okay with standing around. We visited food outlets and got sandwiches and drinks for our journey. What we did find different - and a little offputting - is that you reserve a ticket but then it's a free-for-all. We are used to having a seat number in a particular carriage and therefore strolling to our seats. It's been the case anywhere we have travelled in Europe. Here you have the right to a seat in whichever class you have booked but not a particular seat. I guess we were lucky in that there was very little pushing and shoving and there was plenty of room in the train for everyone to take whichever seat they wished.

Then to find the seats to be so low that even a 10 year old could not sit in them comfortably. It is akin to sitting on the floor with virtually NO LEG ROOM. At least 25% of the show was performed off stage on the front rows of orchestra and was completely obscured from ANY mezzanine seating. Every child in this section attempted to stand on their toes or lean over the railing to try to view the shoe that we all paid in excess of $75.00 per seat yet only could experience 75% of the show. There is a bank of elevators on the lower level that lead to the building next door which once entered one can not get back into the theater and this neighboring building was locked and closed. How absurd, I am handicapped and used this elevator to attempt to return to the first floor of the theater upon the show opening only to find myself locked in a deserted office building. Thankfully we located an unlocked emergency exit in time to return to the theater adjacent. What a freking nightmare. Never again!

This was the most genuine, welcoming congregation ever! I was a little \"put off\" initially that they had us visitors line up outside while the congregation continued to enter, but found out this was so they could sit us with people and congregants who spoke our language. How thoughtful! They also wanted us to know it would be a 2 1\/2 hr experience, so we didn't disrupt the service if that wasn't what we wanted. I completely understood it would be a worship service and not a tourist attraction, and loved every minute of it, as did my 16 yr old.\n The minute we were ushered into the sanctuary, there was harmony and inspiring music you can only imagine....and this is before the service even started! The elderly lady we were seated next to shared her program and Bible with me and my daughter, and a younger lady in front of us turned around to offer us a Bible during the reading of the Word, which everyone participates in. Being from MN, our white skin and very blond hair stuck out and we were welcomed with a warmness I wish my home congregation gave to others. The sermon and \"words from the pulpit\" from other members brought me to tears, and even my daughter agreed with things the pastor was saying during his sermon.\n Many people thanked us for coming, and later, we were blown away again by the outreach of the community. We were 2 subway stops away, looking for a restaurant and were lost walking through the neighborhood. A couple came up to us and the man said \"thank you for coming to our church today\". I was confused as we had passed many churches by now and were far from Convent. I started to say \"I don't think.....\" and he said \"Yes! You were at Convent Ave and sat in front of me. I remember your daughter's jacket\" (really?! Not the white skin or white blond hair?) They proceeded to walk us to the restaurant we were looking for, and offered a better suggestion for soul food (which they were right, Jacob's was amazing and cheaper, but probably less of an ambience). We had a wonderful talk along the walk, and my daughter commented on how kind they were to reach out to us. Life lesson, huh? We were also smooshed in a table at Jacob's with a couple from the neighborhood and again had a nice conversation learning about the area and local soul food restaurants.\n I highly recommend this church to anyone who wants an authentic gospel baptist experience, but please be respectful and dress like you are going to church, talk to the congregation and join in as much as you feel comfortable to get the most out of the experience. And know it is a 2+ hour experience, that goes by in a flash. You will never look at your Sunday mornings the same."}]},{"nearBy":["Hispanic Society of America","Hamilton Grange National Memorial","Morris-Jumel Mansion"]}]},{"NewYorkUniversity.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"70 Washington Square South","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 998 1212"},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":["Greenwich Village","Washington Square Park","No. 19 Washington Square"]}]},{"BeaconTheatre.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"2124 Broadway","postalCode":"10023-1722","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212.465.6225"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"What an amazing older place to see a concert.

The performance of the Band ( outstanding) & the acoustics( superb).

In all 3 concerts here (& the Eagles in Salt Lake City last year) constant loud chatting & toing & froing appear to be the Norm ( @ S.L.C. Gig I complained at interval & was told , by usher, \" they buy their tickets, they can do what they like\": my riposte- that I paid to listen to the band-didn't go down well!)\nSo,what to do? Either embrace the party atmosphere, have a sing-along & have some banter in the bar pre-performance ( they are a friendly crowd) & hope the band play loud.

Best buy theater did do a good job of not making the line mix in with he other travelers although it was confusing to find the end of the line ( thanks for the fans who helped us :) the theadure people made everybody stand in a line with 2 people. And although the workers seamed nice they didn't know anything about the concert and people kept asking him \"what are they standing in line for\" and he said \"some Chinese concert\" :( at 3 the doors opened and we waited at least 15 minutes till we started to walk. The security people checked all bags but if you had nothing they Littertly pushed you to the front door. I got my ticket checked then we went down a escalator to the area. Now here comes the confusing part there was 2 lines, one for merch and one to get in the area. Nobody told us what what was so we got in the area. The space is small but can fit a lot of people. We decided to save our seers and wait in the merchidence line. Now the line was horrible it wrapped 2 times around the area it even went into the the adhere. At last second they said \"we are only selling CDs now it's a first come first service only 1 cd per costumer we will sell everything after he concert\" so my mom waited in the line while she missed some of the concert ( she docent care for idols) the concert started and I wanted to cry. The sounds and lights were amazing. Sound was good but could of been louder. My mom came in during the 3rd song showing us SHE GOT A CD. They only had 400 and we had number 373 success. The concert only lasted a hour and then it was over. At the end if you had a cd you were pushed to the sheets to go to the handshake event. It was very confusing but we had sets 3rd row AWESOME!! They came out we took photos and we got to meat them. Talking to them was awesome but the managers kept pushing you at one point he told my line \"OK WE HAVE 12 MOR ROWS TO GO HOME ON HURRY IT UP\" and I only had 1 second with each member. Not cool. When I got out I saw CD sold out Tee shirt, sold out and photo set sold out he only thing left was TOWELS!!

The main floor is standing room only. Mat put on a great show and it was a great experience! Another plus of the venue is that there is comfortable seats in the back that still have a great view of the stage since it's a pretty compact room. If we were going to see someone that we liked, but didn't love, we'd probably sit back there and still enjoy the show.\n\nWe also attended a Hillsong NYC church service here on another weekend we were in the city.

OK, Not every production has pleased me equally, how could it? But every time I go, I love the unique talent, enthusiasm and novelty this place offers its audience.

It seemed perfect - it's more or less then last building in New York looking out at the Statue of liberty and with only the Staten Island ferry terminus between the church and the water.\n\nThe priest Father Meehan was fantastic - very obliging. He's not exactly computer literate but there are others there who can do the more mundane things like sending emails. Father Meehan was great - he made things very easy for us. We turned up two days before and bought the marriage licence and then on the Saturday he conducted mass and married us.\n\nWe went back again last week (December 2008) to attend mass and will continue to return for as long as we can.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting married in New York (and one of you is a Catholic) - then contact the church. They don't really have a parish as such - and so have plenty of free days to offer for weddings -it's so much nicer than a 30-second service at City Hall."},{"review":"Le bâtiment fut construit en 1793 et l'église en 1883.\n\nElizabeth Ann Seton fut la 1e américaine canonisée par l'église catholique.\n\nElle a vécu ici de 1801 à 1803 et a fondé les Sœurs américaines de la Charité.

Britons renamed it New York, after the Duke of York, brother of King Charles II.\nPeter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch governor of New Amsterdam (future New York), lived on site this handover and his tomb in St Mark's-in-the-Bowery Church is of one whom we can consider a co-founder of the big and important city of our time, a cradle of the European Civilization in America, the Civilization that made America great. \nWhen Stuyvesant came to New Amsterdam, in 1647,there had been only 22 years since Peter Minuit purchased Manhattan,for the Dutch West India Company, from indigenous people living in tents,\"armed\" with bows and arrows and having primitive animist \"religions\" and cruel \"gods\". As European, I was surprised to see American museums praising primitive \"indigenous civilizations\" that brought nothing to the modern and scientific civilization of America, while despising the great European Civilization and great Europeans, like the co-founder of New York, Peter Stuyvesant, whose tomb is uncertainly identified (\"in this vault\") and mentioned on a small, damaged and faded plaque placed somewhere outside the church, on a lateral wall.\nThe main part of this church was built in the late Georgian style (completed and consecrated in 1799, on the church first built by the Stuyvesant family and where Peter Stuyvesant was buried\nin 1672), the steeple was erected in 1828 in the Greek Revival style and the nice wrought and cast iron fence was erected in 1838. The church was nearly destroyed by a strange fire, in 1978,\nso that what we see today is a recent reconstruction.\nFor almost a century, this building hosted vanguard artistic shows (poetry, dance, music) and hosts now some local preservation centers. It is now a globalist cultural center and theoretically\na church, but not a traditional Protestant Church, as it was first.\nThe church was closed, at the time of my visit. What I could see, was the exterior. The most remarkable are the bronze bust of Peter Stuyvesant, donated by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, in 1915, and the tombs of Daniel Tompkins, former vice-president of the United States and, of course, Peter Stuyvesant's. Pretty impressive, the big bell, dating from 1836, cracked in 1978 fire, after ringing for JFK and MLK.\nWhen I came to NYC, I had in mind to visit Ellis Island and St Mark's-in-the-Bowery Church, to pay my tribute to the European founders of New York and America. Ellis Island was closed, at that moment, after the damage caused by hurricane Sandy. St Mark's was also closed, but the items related to Peter Stuyvesant are placed exclusively outside the building, so I could pay my proper tribute. My review here is also part of it."},{"review":"We were delighted to attend Sunday services at this old church where Peter Stuyesant is buried.

The second large exhibit is taken from Shaw's found objects - art from thrift stores, and the most disturbing section, his collection of pedagogical-religious materials.

The entrance was towards the back of Row J (last row of balcony). My seat was in Row B center next to the aisle. Great view of the stage, although I bit of an angled view down. For those wondering if there is a bathroom in the balcony section - there is but a small one. You can barely enter a single room bathroom on the right side of the balcony section. The Lyceum over-all was an intimate theater, I would recommend Mezzanine\/Balcony seats if you don't want to be in the Orchestra (Upper level seats are stadium seating style so views are unobstructed. Avoid First row seats of the Mezzanine and Balcony because view will be obstructed by the railing in front of you. Take Row B instead. If you are afraid of heights, avoid the Balcony, it is pretty steep and going down the stairs can be daunting."},{"review":"The musical is dark and some parts feel old like the revenge plot.

A memorable production in many ways."},{"review":"This is one of those survivors. A theater with history and a cherished house. It needs a good dusting, but is a grand old place that takes you back to what is was. It is incrusted with all the modern lighting and sound, some a little over done. The house is not that small that mics should be necessary yet in todays theater you can't go without. It has handicapped accessible. The toilets are modern and kept. The staff are polite and professional. The seats are close, but everything is in short supply of space in NYC. We where there to see the Preview of \"the Visit\" with Chita Rivera.

The overall performances were of the actors, however, were subpar as compared to performances we\u2019ve recently seen on Broadway. The actor who played \u2018Amir\u2019 was quite hoarse which, subsequently, made it difficult to understand his lines at times and degraded his performance. \n\nPerhaps this was a bad day at the theater \u2026 but from what we experienced, 3 Stars \u2026 is about right."},{"review":"I went and saw A View From the Bridge, and even though the show is not my preferred style, I appreciated the work and consideration that went into its production.

I had a rush ticket with a banister obstructing my view. Before the show the banisters were removed on both sides improving sightless for a grand total of 12 patrons.

In this manner, to be fair, we felt the show was good but not a great musical, one we enjoyed watching but would probably not pay to see again without Sting being a cast member. \n\nWhat we will long remember is simply being in a generally small theatre house and being able to see the musical genuine perform. Sure, his movements were awkward at times and he was clearly not natural or even fully comfortable with the dance routines. However, this mattered not, it was still a pleasure watching Sting perform live. \n\nWhile the production itself was good, the musical scores were great. We did enjoy the musical scores and are still humming the 'The Last Ship' number five weeks later. \n\nIn the end, we much enjoyed The Last Ship, mainly because of Sting being a part of the cast. Fans visiting the city, might want to look into this show while Sting remains part of the cast. Its appeal will reduce tremendously afterwards."},{"review":"What a wonderful intimate theatre! We saw Sting's The Last Ship and enjoyed the performance as well."},{"review":"Excellent show - run is ending - the memories never will. We had great seats in what seems to be a small theater on Broadway. The show was awesome."},{"review":"The Neil Simon Theater currently hosts \"The Last Ship\", but only through the 24th of January, 2015. There's not much time left for the show on Broadway ... all the more reason to get a ticket to see it, before that last performance and here's why:\n\nThere is so much to love and enjoy about this wonderful production. Yes, it's by Sting. Yes, it features Sting. Yes, Sting's touch is evident in his hometown story, the lyrics and music. But Sting is just the icing on this cake. The story, the stage, the feel of this musical endeavor will touch you ... and have you leaving the theater wondering why in the world it didn't enjoy more success. There are good threads woven into this story. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy grows up to be a man, and tries again. Workers sticking together to try to stick it to the bosses. A father and a son, and a son and a father. Blue collar pride and purpose, in the making of a product hailed as \"a mountain of steel.\" And love. There's a lot here that resonates with the audience in any number of combinations. \n\nVisually, the stage is impressive and clever. A few little changes here and there, a prop or two, carried in or off by the actors ... and you find yourself in the shipyard, in the pub, and in a church. \nSo many wonderful moments in this show, by all the cast members. You'll have a hard time picking just one favorite moment from the entire evening. It's really a complete package: story, set, and score.\n\nMusically the score is ear candy of the best kind, and bears its' composer's mark. If you're familiar with Sting's music, you'll recognize a few songs that were written before the musical was created, but fit in quite well with the story. His new songs about his town of Wallsend bear his signature chord changes and insightful lyrics, which propel the story right into your heart. (If you've read his book, you'll see another example of this. The man can craft words and paragraphs that literally have a cadence and a musicality all their own .. and those are just PRINTED words.) And a word of advice, get back to your seat promptly after intermission. You don't want to miss Shawna Hamic's song with the ladies at the beginning of Act 2.\n\nThe theater is small and intimate. The rows may feel a little tight, but they're not uncomfortable. The sight line from the mezzanine was great. The actors are on the stage as well as above it, on side balconies, and a center 'bridge'. Lots of symbolism there too with different actors, portraying the same characters at different times, who at one point are singing together on this bridge. Clever touch. And Sting, though not the main character of the story, makes his way around and up, so you'll get a clear view of him wherever you're sitting.\n\nYou'll leave the theater with a great appreciation of just how hard people work to make a Broadway show. And that realization will be all the more bittersweet with the last closing week of performances. This musical has all the right things, in all the right places to continue on. Hopefully it will find a new life elsewhere, maybe in the West End. That would be a great homecoming for this worthy ship, from a shipyard in Wallsend."},{"review":"Excellent musical! My husband and I missed this on the short opening run in Chicago, so when we found out it was on the way to NYC, we were elated and immediately purchased tickets. It was only after we'd been seated at the musical and reading our Playbills did we find out that Sting would be part of the cast. I nearly jumped out of my seat, being a Sting fan for nearly his entire career. However, as one reviewer had mentioned, Sting does not carry the musical....the musical carries itself. So even if you're not a fan, go see this. It's a well written story with a talented cast and the music is excellent. \nIf you wait by the stage door after the show, the friendly cast, including Sting, will sign your Playbill as they leave the theatre."},{"review":"We saw Gigi at this theatre in May 2015. The theatre is not as ornate as some of the older ones, but it is cozy, comfortable, and small enough that wherever your seat is located, you will be able to see the show well.

I like to rent a bike up on 72nd and West End (much cheaper than the places along the bike path though those are more convenient so whatever). I ride the whole thing, battery to GW bridge. It's mostly flat and very civilized with separate lanes for cyclists and walkers, in both directions, and traffic lights for the occasional traffic that crosses to the water.\n\nHidden art everywhere in pocket parks...sculptures tucked away. You have to get off the bike occasionally to see those, and also grab a bite or drink at one of the cafes along the park. \n\nTo truly spend a day, rent a bike lock so you can go to the barge bar\/restaurant (forget the name, old train barge) and maybe even hit up the High Line. \n\nOnce i took the ferry over to Liberty State Park in NJ, rode the bike around over there too, then back.

The park has excellent views of the river, a charming cover, the NY Holocaust Museum, and many places to eat and drink. You'll arrive mid-park at the NY Marina (small, and you'd best be a billionaire to dock there). Explore the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center and the art gallery and shops there. You might then continue on to the WTC site, One Observatory (for spectacular views of the city), the 911 Memorial reflecting pools, and the 911 museum (underground and, for me, depressing).

It is off West Broadway in the Tribeca area of Manhatten. $8 entance fee. The visit is about an hour and worth the stop."},{"review":"We are native New Yorkers who live elsewhere now, but visit New York City about six times a year. Recently, I came across a reference to The Anne Frank Center on the Internet and it raised my curiosity as I had never heard of it before. Surprisingly, I didn't find mention of this Center in any of my NYC tour books. What an omission -- as this Center is a gem. And even more surprising was that the Center representative told us that the Center has been in NYC since 1972!\n\nThough Lower Manhattan has several well-known sites to remind us of the mass murder of people (e.g., Museum of Jewish Heritage, Museum of the American Indian, and the National 9\/11 Memorial), this particular site personalizes it more. As the name says, the Center focuses on the life of Anne Frank, a Jewish teen, who lived in Germany and then in Holland during WWII. She and her family hid from the Nazis until someone anonymously reported them to the Nazis, and she and her family were sent to Concentration Camps. All but her father died in the camps of starvation and disease. Her father had his daughter's writings published and it became famous world-wide -- \"The Diary of Anne Frank.\" \n\nHowever, with the passing of time, many children no longer know who Anne Frank was and have not read or heard of her book, So I was thrilled to see a Museum devoted to her in New York City. This Center has a 30 minute movie about Anne, has a time line with photos of her life, has a model of the house she hid in, replicas of her photo album and diary, and a life size picture of what her bedroom would have looked like. \n\nWe visited t he Center with one of our children (the Center also provides special educational programs for school children and adult groups -- even a one-woman show!). It did not take us long to visit this Museum (approximately an hour), however, it was well-worth the stop. I highly recommend that everyone make the time to visit the Center (just note that it is closed on Sundays and Mondays)."},{"review":"I stopped by with my 9-year-old daughter, recently interested in Anne Frank, and found it a very nice way to round out her knowledge of Anne Frank and her family.\n\nThe space is quite small, and can be taken in in well under an hour.

You have beautiful views of lower Manhattan, Brooklyn, The Statue of Liberty, Governor's Island and Ellis Island. The sunset cruise from 7-9 pm is particularly excellent. You can also join the crew in hoisting the sails. The 1885 schooner PIONEER is an authentic 19th Century schooner, with public sails daily from May through October. This is one of the best and most low-key, special sailing options from the Seaport, or anywhere, in New York City. You are allowed to pack a lunch or snack and come on board. Restroom facilities are extremely modest--remember, it's an old ship. It was such a great sail, I even considered volunteering on the crew on a regular basis! The crew consists of New Yorkers (and professional sailors) who volunteer regularly to crew the vessel. This is a VERY special New York attraction! It is not a party boat--no music blasting, no heavy drinking. Go elsewhere for those attractions. Great for families, couples, good friends. I loved watching teens pretend they weren't smiling when they got the chance to hoist the sails! One of them even stopped texting for almost the whole two hours.

But if you want breathtaking views with the sound of the wind in the sails, you'll love this like we did."},{"review":"I'm pretty much against organised tourist trips. This one is different. You set sail across New York harbour with a bunch of amateur sailing enthusiasts who are seriously into their boat, The Pioneer. The boat is gorgeous and majestic. The rookie crew explain some of the history and let you have a go on the rigging. On a sunny day, the view is breathtaking and the voyage is calm. It's one of the few organised tours I would vouch for."},{"review":"Redefining the word \"Museum\" to include an 1885 schooner rigged sailboat that carries 40 people around New York Harbor is a neat trick, but the South Street Seaport Museum does it with style and tradition. A preserved 1885 working sailboat open for both public sails and private charters, \"Pioneer\" has been a fabulous not-in-your-basic-guidebook resource. Setting out from the Seaport Museum on Pier 16 in the East River, about 40 of us sailed around Governors Island, out into the Harbor with breath-taking views of the Verrazano Bridge, the Statue of Liberty and the lower Manhattan skyline and back in a two hour cruise that we will remember for years to come. The skipper and crew could not have been friendlier, and when passengers were invited to help raise the sails, we had a brief --but real-- sense of what sailors had to do before modern day power resources were available.

We got great seats in the orchestra - 5 rows back....but the theatre is small, so I don't think it would matter too much where you sit.\n\nAll 3 actors were incredibly convincing, moving and hilarious. Cera was fantastically awkward, and I cringed wholeheartedly as he danced along with Tavi. Tavi, although new to Broadway (and so young!) was incredible. Reading her bio in the program, I was pretty shocked - this girl is pretty much a child prodigy - definitely one to watch out for. And Culkan - so good. He had a lot of crazy monologues and didn't skip a beat...just completely believable. \n\nI really didn't know a play could be this good. I got so completely caught up in it all.

Some walking required to reach the Lighthouse from the road nearby."},{"review":"I like lighthouses and I always try to visit some when I travel. Some years ago, I saw, from far away, this little red lighthouse from a boat tour (circle line tour ; but we couldn't go close to it because of a problem that day). So I wanted to go. I had read those reports here and decided to try to find my way. It is easier than some people say here. We took a bus till 181st street and from there, we followed what Google told us, and it is easy to find (or you can follow the indications with \"Hudson bike\" there ; it is about 15-20 minutes to walk from the bus (or metro) station. If you love lighthouses, you should do this visit. We then walked along the Greenway till 125th street and it is a lovely walk too."},{"review":"This is NOT located as indicated on the map on this page. It is directly under the George Washington Bridge on the New York side of the Hudson River."},{"review":"On a rainy Thanksgiving day eve, I took the 'A' train to Fort Washington Avenue and 181st. Street to visit Jeffrey's Hook Light, affectionately known as Little Red Lighthouse. With no specific walking directions to the lighthouse, I asked a street vendor and an ambulance driver for the quickest way to Fort Washington Park where Little Red stands. Following their helpful tips, I went west on 181st. Street passing Plaza Lafayette and turned right on Riverside Drive. A short walk and turning left onto the Hudson River Greenway, a pedestrian overpass and two pedestrian tunnels later, finally took me to the lighthouse, proudly settled almost directly under the George Washington Bridge. Despite a slightly treacherous path and the cold crosswinds of the Hudson River, my mile-long trek culminated with the delightful sight of the red lighthouse, standing majestic on the riverbank.\n\nTo those of you who feel a love for lighthouses, the Little Red Light is a must see when visiting Manhattan, a hidden treasure tucked away on the eastern end pier of the George Washington Bridge."},{"review":"We were wandering in Riverside Park when I spotted this little bright red lighthouse under the GWB. It seemed like a familar sight but I didn't know at the time where I had seen it before. Getting closer, I realized that this was a scene from a storybook that I had read as a child, specifically \"The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge\". It's always a joy to discover a real place from a book.\n\nOther than recognizing the scene and photographing it, we didn't stay too long at this spot."},{"review":"Recently visited walking from a historic park in Fort Lee, NJ, across the George Washington Bridge. I think the round trip walk at a reasonable pace took a little more than an hour, but I am not sure. This is a beautiful spot. The sight of the lighthouse with the bridge behind is impressive. After getting off the bridge the walk to the lighthouse was longer than I expected, not obvious but able to be figured out for someone who did not plan ahead. Walking trails, overpasses, and tunnels are required to get around the higher speed roadways near the river. The overall experience of walking the bridge and visiting the park was fantastic, but I wish the park immediately around the lighthouse was a bit more extensive and manicured so that those visiting could better appreciate the experience. Also, with the exception of the historic park where I started, I noticed no bathrooms or anyplace where water (public fountain or vending machine) was available."},{"review":"Located on the Hudson River just under the George Washington Bridge.... the Little Red Lighthouse. Although I made the trek, it wasn't open and later found that it is open the 2nd Saturday of months June-October. Admission is free. To get here - take the Subway to 181st street and prepare to walk a little bit."},{"review":"You're unlikely to stumble across the Little Red Lighthouse, but if you do , or better still if you set out to find it, ideally on a bicycle, it's well worth the trip. You'll find yourself a world away from the city, in place where you might expect Thomas the Tank Engine to whistle across the great grey bridge under which the Lighthouse nestles. Decommissioned in 1921, it evoke a sense of connection with history, and not surprisingly, has become a favourite for New York School trips. Peaceful surroundings, you really feel that you have gone beyond the city limits, into a place where time stands still.

We stopped here on the way home from a weekend in Hyde Park, to honor Saint Frances Xavier Cabrini. A member of the family had told us that she had visited this Shrine back in the 1950s, and before she had shared this we did not even know that the Shrine was there! A bit off the beaten path, it was a little challenging to find at first (we even got lost for a while), but we were so happy to have found this peaceful Shrine. The Shrine is essentially a modern construction in which you can visit and pray at the tomb of Saint Frances Cabrini. It was very moving to see so much reverence and devotion among the faithful gathered there. Mass was lively and upbeat.

I'm familiar with the social history of the UK in the period mostly covered (second half of the nineteenth century) and it was fascinating to make comparisons.

The Museum was gifted to the public and now gives a wonderful insight into the social history of a 19th century New York family.\n The museum alters the display over the course of the year. Our visit coincided with halloween, for which the Mueum appropriately chose death as the theme. It celebrated the painful demise in 1865 in the bed of the household head, complete with body in the bedroom, coffin in the front parlour, womenfolk in widow weeds, and black crepe hung over the mirrors. \nVery fittingly at this time of year, the Museum has an attraction few of its competitors can boast in the form of a genuine ghost. We didn't happen upon the spirit, or at least not wittingly.Nevertheless, the place has a certain atmosphere, and for a relatively small building the passageways, and rooms stairs have a certain uneasy character, particularly when company is scarce, that could easily become unsettling. The visitor can either explore by themselves accompanied only by a rather unwieldy binder providing a commentary on each room, or by guided tour. \nEntry tickets are 10 dollars per adult, children under twelve enter free. \nOur eleven year old (with an interest in history) quickly became absorded in the guide book , and afterwards gave a thumbs up to the experience."},{"review":"The museum represents wealthy family house 19th century.

We attended at 9:30 on Sunday and I suggest getting there 15-20 minutes before the service starts as the line was quite long (but everyone got in). The setting seems to be an old cinema theatre. Video and photo's are allowed (except during the donation period). The preaching and singing were excellent my only complaint was the sound quality at the back was not the best. Church members were very friendly from the lining up outside the church to the directions and welcoming during the service. Must not be missed."},{"review":"We went to the 11:30 service. Arrived after 11, joined a long line on the 116th street that looked too long to fit us all in, but we were all seated on the balcony with lots of seats to spare. Keep your water in the bag as drinks are not allowed, and maybe bring a long straw so you can take a sip when an opportunity arises. All but one of many volunteers were super nice. You can wear pretty much anything you want, and plenty of people left early, very early, and too early. Many were late as well. You can take photos, not sure about video. The earlier services probably end on time \u2013 the last one went on for 2.5 hours. If you want to make a donation, you'll have to wait til the end and place your money in the envelope provided. But I am pretty sure that I saw people who left early hand in their envelopes to the volunteers. Men's toilets are balcony right and the ladies on the left. Overall, as a tourist, you will not feel out of place or unwelcomed. I think they make enough extra cash in our donations that they keep the expectation bar low for us.\n\nWe were actually hoping for a choir, but there were only six singers on stage, plus the keyboard player singing. The music director plays the piano, there was an OK drummer and a very good bass player. The sound was fairly horrendous. The music was surprisingly funky and modern, quite generic but easy to follow. I am not religious, but I found the experience uplifting and all the preachers were very energetic, some even infectiously enthusiastic.\n\nP.S. I noticed some scaredy-cats comments, so I just want to add that the neighborhood and getting there on the subway are perfectly safe, not any less than most in NYC."},{"review":"We went to the 9:30am service. The first thing you need to know is that you need to arrive well before your chosen service (there are three on Sunday morning) and they form a queue.

I should add that the place is huge and all guests are seated in the balcony. There did not seem to be any issue with what to wear - I wore dress shorts and a collared shirt.\nThe service last about 2 hours but some people left before that. We were allowed to take video and or pictures - I did both.\n\nOverall, it was a cool experience. We got to hear the gospel music for the first half an hour followed by the pastor give her sermon.

The museum is free ($5 donation requested) and takes about 30 minutes to see the three galleries, if that. But if you're more technically adept than I am and can figure out the audio tour on your phone, you can probably spend closer to 45 minutes. \n\nThe current exhibit was Art Brut, so even though is the American Folk Art Museum, it seemed like most everything was from Europe or from an artist from the Philippines. The museum did a good job explaining how a French artist (Debuffet) came up with the term Art Brut in the late 1940s to describe \"Outsider Art\" and what he meant. His examples of art outside of the mainstream included artists who were mental hospital patients and work by children. \n\nI don't know a ton about art, but it was pretty intriguing to note that self-taught artists came up with work that reminded me of Miro, Henri Rousseau, Picasso, and Jackson Pollock. There was also work that reminded me of stone mosaics from Mexico (Mayan, maybe?) even though this work was oil on canvas. Some of the works by a patient in a Swiss hospital (Heinrich Anton Muller) in the 1920s were fascinating in the same way Munch's The Scream is and, really, more affecting than what I've seen from de Kooning. \n\nGreat and friendly docents made sure I knew about upcoming tours and events. Also, the museum provides free cubbies with locks for jackets - nice. Right across the street from the 1 Train at 66th\/Lincoln Center. Also a short walk to Strawberry Fields and the Sheep Meadow in Central Park.

They ask for a $5 contribution, but frankly, there was little worth seeing. The gift shop hinted at wonderful previous exhibitions, but only one exhibit at a time is present now. \n\nThe hours are also difficult if you happen to be in town to see shows.

The museum was donated several collections from folk art lovers and chose to expose very different pieces (paintings, furniture, toys, signs...). Some painters seem to have been well knowned at some point but somehow didn't stay or didn't make it to the main art museums of the city. A lot of pieces were also from unknown origins.\nIf you visit NYC for a short time there is no need to put this museum on your list but if you live here or have time then go there. It is always interesting to learn about folk art and artists and why we insist to oppose it to professional and schooled art."},{"review":"Interesting collection of early, self-trained American artists.

Admission is free, but karma will do what karma will do, so do put something in the donation box on the way out. They have lockers if you want to look around without coat or backpack, but figure staying here about an hour, tops, particularly if you're around for a docent tour. This isn't a destination stop, but there's so much going on in this neighborhood that it's a great add-on, before dinner or after lunch -- I usually stop in after lunch and before a movie.

Highly recommend spending some time in the village and treating yourself to this amazing production!"},{"review":"Before I begin, let me first say that I really wanted to like this play and that I kept the faith returning after intermission (unlike many others) only to be disappointed. \n\nThe basic story line is clever and had considerable potential. Three misfits working at an old movie theatre not long for this world. The set was also clever with audience seats on stage facing the real audience. The problem is the story never really went anywhere and the execution was awful. The rule for any show is pacing. Pacing here was not non-existent. There were MANY onstage pauses of 30, 60, even 90 seconds that essentially ground the show to a halt. I even timed one of them as I could not believe the director would have intended\/allowed such long and senseless pauses. One pause occurred when a character left the stage to put something in his car off-stage and we all sat and waited in silence for well over a minute while nothing happened onstage. A misguided attempt at trying to create reality for the audience. I guess we were all supposed to sit silently imagining the character walking to his car, opening the trunk, loading the trunk, and then returning tot he stage. 15 seconds maximum would have done it. I could have easily cut 45 minutes from this show and it would never have been missed. Probably would have improved the production 100 fold. An almost 3 hour play in somewhat uncomfortable seats had better be extremely engaging otherwise the audience is gone.\n\nThe actors were also somewhat lacking as they often projected poorly and were difficult to hear despite the fact I was in the 3rd row. At intermission, many of those sitting further back complained they could not hear at all and were quite angry. The actors never connected with the audience or drew us in enough to care about their characters. A number of potentially interesting story lines were started during the show but few were ever developed. I have to say I felt like I was watching a grammar school production not an off-Broadway show. I have seen a number of fabulous productions at the Barrow Street Theatre but this was clearly not one of them. I do not understand how the Barrow could have felt this production was of an acceptable quality to allow it to open. I came out of the theatre feeling as if I had been subjected to 3 hours of torture, robbed (tickets are not cheap), and was quite unhappy about it. Not what you want when you are out with your mate for a special evening.

Most of the prints are gelatine silver, and range from size 10\u201D x 8\u201D to 20\u201D x 16\u201D and are either signed or embossed with the photographer\u2019s signature. \n\nThe unframed prints are available for between $900 and $5,000 each.\n\nAlthough these images may be beyond the means of most visitors, there are two tables crammed with discounted (and pristine condition) photographic books. These are currently very reasonably priced at either $10 or $20 each! \n\nThe exhibitions rotate frequently and all are free (I believe) to view, so there is no excuse not to learn from the masters and thereby be inspired to create new images.\n\nDetails of current and future exhibitions are available at http:\/\/en.leica-camera.com\/culture\/galleries\/gallery_new_york\/ \n\nThe opening hours of the Gallery are Tuesday to Saturday, noon to 6pm. \n\nAlthough the Gallery is small enough to maintain the interest of non-photographic buffs, it is obviously aimed at Leica owners, those who are aspiring to be or those with more than a passing interest in photography. \n\nIf you have such an interest, I\u2019m sure that the trip to Greenwich Village will be worthwhile."},{"review":"A Galeria fixa no 5° Andar.

NYC was a late comer to this useful and healthy tradition: farmers markets virtually did not exist in urban areas twenty years ago.

But both sides kept trying and I am happy to say we are now in the best of all worlds: prices have become completely reasonable (in some cases even better than the Supermarket), quality is great and buyers, well, buyers have learned to trust and appreciate the freshness of products and the pride of the producers and we all live happily thereafter.\n There is a whole bunch of locations for the Greenmarket nowadays and everybody loves them.

The parisioners are diverse and welcoming. \n\nAnd the history of the church, its clergy and those it served is awe inspiring."},{"review":"I have never attended a mass at Corpus Christi. I have, instead, known it is as the decades-long home to the best Early Music series probably anywhere, Music Before 1800. The main reason for this series success is probably its director, Louise Basbas. However, the sanctuary is a perfect setting for small ensemble performances, both acoustically and in terms of the beauty of the sanctuary.\n\nFor some context, Corpus Christi is actually just north of Columbia University campus, and down the street from Union Theological Seminary and Riverside Church. So if you do happen to be coming to Corpus Christi for a performance, I would suggest coming out early to have a chance to see Columbia's campus, Union Theological and Riverside Church (and even Grant's Tomb)."}]},{"nearBy":["Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine","Apollo Theater","Columbia University"]}]},{"StatueofConfucius.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"Confucius Plaza","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"The location of the statue is actually on the southwest section of Confucius Plaza.

We were literally covered in it: it was wrapped around our arms and legs, and it brushed up against us constantly. There would be no way to swim without it covering your face and getting tangled in your hair.\n- There were three outdoor showers with ice cold water; no indoor showers so you couldn't really get clean\n- The bathroom was very messy and smelly; needed way more frequent tending to (and the lines were very long)\n- You can only enter the water between the two green flags, which the lifeguards move frequently. So if you think you can just get off your beach chair and race into the water, you're wrong! lol\n- The beach rental people will literally walk right in front of where you're sitting, and plop down chairs and umbrellas, effectively blocking your view of the ocean.

In the case of Manhattan\u2019s East and West side the divider is Fifth Avenue and Central Park in the upper portion. The East side, especially the Upper part (separate review) is predominantly \u201Cblue blood\u201D, old money, finance, chic, ultra exclusive and dominated by draconian coop-boards. The West side is liberal, bohemian, brash, trashy and populated by show biz & literati. At one time or another Lauren Bacall, Barbra Streisand, Mia Farrow, Bruce Willis, Alex Baldwin, Faye Dunaway, John Lennon & Yoko Ono, Sean Penn and James Dean have called it a home.\n The Upper West Side is roughly from the mid 50s to the mid 90s and West of Fifth Avenue.

If you walk on Broadway(separate review) starting from downtown, you will go through Bohemian Greenwich Village(separate review) first: check out the schedule of the Film Forum (separate review) and IFC center (separate review), two very unique film venues in the City.

The Garment and the Theater district follow, the first one being responsible for a large part of the garments still designed and manufactured in the U.S. and the latter \u2013 where all the Broadway and off-Broadway etc. fun is. Linger for a while at Times Square (separate review) and check the Discount Tickets booth while there. Continue Uptown and you\u2019ll reach Columbus Circle (separate review). While traffic circles are common in large European Cities, they are a rarity in the carefully and methodically planed grid of Manhattan: this is virtually the only large one. The statue in the middle is, who else, Christopher Columbus himself and the two shiny new towers reaching for the sky offer one of the most expensive real estate in Manhattan. \n Continuing North you\u2019ll reach Lincoln Center (separate review) and Fariway, an interesting market even further North.

It is among the many places in the world that gays, lesbians and their supporters should attend to feel the beginnings of the movement and imagine what it must have been like to be there. The historic role it plays in setting the gay movement in motion throughout the world cannot be underestimated.\n\nThe park is small, frequented by regulars who are clearly local - possibly patrons of the Stonewall Inn when the movement began. Statues of a male couple and a female couple have been erected with a story board detailing the importance of the area. \n\nPersonally, sitting there allows me to reconnect with my gay pride and the reasons I've been a social justice advocate for nearly 40 years. Take the time, sit quietly and understand this historically important place."},{"review":"This historic almost 200 hundred years old park afforded the best seats to watch the Stonewall Riots. Quick thinking spectators came here and stood on benches and overturned trash barrels to watch the fray happening across the street. In the 1980's a copy of George Segal's figures titled Gay Liberation was placed here. The group consists of the figures of a lesbian couple (seated) and a gay male couple (standing). Tourists love to have their photos taken in front of The Stonewall Inn then have a photo taken standing amongst Segal's figures. Across from the east point of the wedge shaped park is The Northern Dispensary which was founded in 1827 and put up in 1835 making it two years older than the park. The dispensary's purpose was to provide medical service to the 'worthy poor' as it did for Edgar Allan Poe who lived nearby at 137 Waverly Place. This beautiful little triangular building has the distinction of facing two streets on one side (Grove Street melds into Christopher Street on this side) and the other two sides are on the same street because at one corner of the building Waverly Place branches off with one branch continuing a few feet along one side of the building and the other branch continues several blocks on the other side. You can have your photo taken at the corner of Waverly Place and Waverly Place next to the street sign. A little further east on Waverly at 116 Poe and Melville often attended a literary salon held there on Saturdays. The park was cleaned up in the 1980's. The fence which is over 130 years old was kept but a new main gate was added. This little park may be said to be in the heart of the West Village and I think along with The Stonewall Inn and Northern Dispensary is definitely worth a peek."},{"review":"Famoso y pequeño parque donde se encuentran las estatuas de parejas en color blanco muy famosas.

The park provides an honest invitation to customize your own piece of NYC.... at least temporarily. The presence of a small food vendor (who delivered my food to my table) allowed me to longer."},{"review":"Tiny it may be but Paley Park packs a punch out of proportion to its size.

I called box office to let them know of the situation. They were so pleasant and understanding. Yet, they told me they could make no promises or guarantees but to call another morning, when she was okay, to see if there was any open seats. Fortunately, the day before we left, there were 3 open seats, so we were able to go. My husband does not generally go to plays or shows and he was not looking forward to it, like Mom and I were.

I was not some random person off the street and it didn't matter that I was the one who actually paid for 2 tickets.

In most (not all) the theatres there was not adequate provision for the audience pre-show.

Clearly learning from the experiences of its British Theatres the Ambassadors Group make the whole visit enjoyable. The customer service was exemplary and set standards which, I'm afraid the other Theatres couldn't meet! So, for example, a regular feature of other theatres was that the interval bars were understaffed and couldn't cope with demand meaning that the customers couldn't get back to their seats before the 2nd Acts and disturbed others when getting back to their seats - unacceptable at Broadway (or any) price but it does hurst when $120 seats are commonplace. Keep it up Lyric and raise those Broadway Customer service standards. The show itself?

Before that, it was \"The Lower East Side,\" with an equally diverse mix, dominated by Italians, Jews, Germans and other immigrants who had recently made their way to this country and were in need of cheap housing. Prior to that, it was exclusively the property of native Americans... but that was so long ago that I'm having trouble remembering exactly what the neighborhood was like back then (though I do remember it was much quieter and greener than it is today).\n\nNow, it's trendy and so way cool that to live there it's like you need to be let in by the doorman of a hot night club. NYU students and hipsters have pushed out the punk rockers, hippies and (most of the) junkies and are everywhere sipping lattes, buying hipster clothes and wobbling out of the bars at 4 am. Don't be fooled, though... if you'd like to move here and you're not earning six figures, you will have to look in Brooklyn or Queens, because this neighborhood is no longer affordable to the working class that built it. \n\nBut, take heart... Thompkins Square Park is still one of the greatest places in Manhattan for its gritty diversity... you can still see a group of stoned cold junkies [rent stabilized apartments is the explanation for their presence] nodding out on a park bench just 30 feet away from a playground full of toddlers, kids, moms and nannies. [Probably, no nanny was ever sighted in this neighborhood until the 1990s gentrification] The Park was historically \"home\" to the vibrant socialist movement of days long gone, but still is reliable for an anarchist demonstrations every so often.

A la lecture des différents commentaires notre principale crainte était de tomber dans les usines à touristes où certes le spectacle est probablement beau mais pas très authentique, avec de surcroit de l'attente à l'entrée. \nBref, c'est donc au hasard des rues, non loin de la sortie du métro (125 st) que nous avons découvert l' Elmendorf Reformed Church. \nCertes, de l'extérieur elle ne paie pas de mine.

You would be forgiven for not even noticing the square considering the bright buildings and visual stimulus surrounding you in this area of NYC. \n\nThe square is named after Father Patrick Duffy, a priest and military chaplain who greatly served the nation and the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. \n\nWhat you will find at Duffy Square is a staged platform area, used for crowd congregating, situated directly behind a bronze statue of Father Duffy standing in front of a Celtic Cross. It is a good spot for taking photographs of Times Square if you want to avoid obstructed views at street level. \n\nIt is a neat place to stop and few the lit buildings, especially at night time.

Its surprising how much time you can spend watching the illuminations and people watch from up there and its got even better now they have pedestrianised one side of the square.\n\nIf Central Park (The best free thing in New York) is the lungs of the city this is its rapidly beating heart.

The owner, Bill Brady, runs the ATM that appears in the front of the space. This is a tradition taken from his original East Village space. The rest of the space is similar to the East Village space as well. Its alot like a shotgun house common in New Orleans. The shows are always very modern and relevant. Three of the galleries artists appeared in the 2005 \"greater New York\" show at PS-1. ATM also travels to most of the most prestigious art shows, like the NADA fair in Miami. but the attitude of the gallery is open and friendly. Bill Brady and Lital Mehr run the space, and both are extremely affable. This attitude translates into the approachable nature of the work.

At the summit is the Fire Watchtower, the only survivor of several originally built, dating back to 1855."},{"review":"Most New Yorkers are familiar with Shakespeare in the Park, and if you are visiting New York it is certainly worth the time in line to score tickets to this free event. Less well-known, but much more accessible is The Classical Theatre of Harlem whose production of Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream will run until July 30. The performances are free and are presented in The Richard Rogers Amphitheater at Marcus Garvey Park (5th Ave. between 120th St. and 124th St. Tuesday \u2013Sunday at 7:30 PM, rain or shine. Viewing and acoustics are good from every seat, and rest rooms are adjacent.\nThe play is faithful to the language of Shakespeare, but like Shakespeare the director has taken liberties with the locale. This is neither Elizabethan England nor Greece. The setting is in \u201Cthe woods\u201D of Harlem. The characters take on an urban air with props like a huge \u201Cbeatbox\u201D radio and a Helena with a distinct Hispanic flair and accent to match. The director, Justin Emeka, transforms the characters in such a way that the audience can immediately identify with them, yet he never is unfaithful to the Bard.\nThere are amazing dance sequences for the fairies choreographed by Laika Worrel. Although this performance was outdoors, the sound was excellent. I cannot say enough about the individual performers. The play within the play at the end was hilarious. You can find their biographies on www.classicaltheatreofharlem.org. Setting, costume design and sound were truly magical. The ninety minute production without an intermission seemed to pass in a flash.\nAt the end of the performance, the audience was given the opportunity to make donations on the way out, but there was no pressure to do so. I\u2019m glad to say I saw many people who were thankful for this marvelous production doing the right thing. \nPlease give this organization the support it needs.

The Harlem River - which is actually a sound - not a river, connects the East River (also a sound, not a river) with the Hudson River (which really is a river, & a mighty one at that!); it separates Manhattan from the Bronx. If walking from south to north, the route starts on 155th Street, west of the Macombs Dam Bridge, which gives access to the Bronx at the Yankee Stadium & the Bronx County Courthouse. Walk northward on Harlem River Drive, with the steep slope of the High Bridge Park on the left, & some ugly high-rise apartments on the right. After a short walk you're at the waterside, & will continue to be for about 2 mi\/3 km. The whole walk is pleasant, even though the busy Harlem River Drive is all the time immediately to your left. You'll pass under 3 bridges in close succession: the High Bridge (1848; new central span 1923), the oldest extant bridge crossing from Manhattan to anywhere (slated to reopen, to pedestrians only, this year); the Alexander Hamilton Bridge (1964), which carries I-95 & connects with the George Washington Bridge; & the Washington Bridge (not to be confused with the GEORGE Washington Bridge; 1889). Further on you pass, on the Bronx side, the towering River Park Towers (apartments; 1975) - all 40-odd floors of them! - then the Roberto Clemente State Park, also on the Bronx side.\n Close to the end of the Greenway, the pretty Smuggler Cove Park is on your right. Here are pleasant pathways going between trees & crossing goldfish ponds, to a fishing pier, a salt marsh (one of only 2 in Manhattan - the other is in Inwood Hill Park), & a boathouse on the water; restrooms are available. Just after this the route ends, at the intersection of Harlem River Drive, 10th Avenue & Dyckman Street; this is close to the University Heights Bridge. Note that there is no way to get out of the Greenway, or into it, anywhere between the beginning & the end - there is no access to the High Bridge Park, & also none to any of the bridges. Speaking of bridges, it is worth walking on each & every bridge that crosses from Manhattan to anywhere!\n Note also that there is no waterside walkway anywhere between 120th Street & 155th Street, although there might be in the future.

The fireworks seemed larger than life, almost as if they were shot off just for my husband and me! It did get a little crowded, but not as crowded as Astoria park gets for the fireworks and outdoor concert each year.

Facilities are quite limited, so bring your own water\/food\/snack if you plan to spend any time on the island. There are designated bbq area and picnic tables.

I generally love outdoor concerts, and I've seen a handful of festival shows at this venue. While I greatly enjoyed the music & atmosphere each time, I thought the facilities, especially the bathroom facilities, were terrible. Granted, I haven't been to a show at Randall's Island in a few years so maybe things have changed. Back then, I was a tad younger and I could tolerate poor conditions in exchange for really great music. It wasn't that long ago, and I still consider myself to be on the younger side, so I'd be willing to go to another Randall's Island show if something interesting catches my eyes. Although, I think for the most part, I prefer venues that are a bit more...comfortable."},{"review":"We took our bikes and rode up the East river bike path and then went over the footbridge to Randall-Wards Island. It was so quiet you would never believe you were between Manhattan and Queens. We were able to ride without interruption and enjoy the spectacular views of the East River and Manhattan. Admittedly, the time we went was in January so it probably was not the season, don';t know what it is like in the spring\/summer. But it was a great hideaway at least for that time of the year"},{"review":"Wards Island & Randalls Island are 2 islands, joined by landfill in the 1930's, in the sound east of Manhattan. The East River is to the south-west, the Harlem River to the north, & the Long Island Sound to the east; all are sounds, not bona fide rivers. Across the water, Manhattan's East Harlem neighborhood is to the west, the Mott Haven district of the Bronx is to the north, & the Astoria section of Queens is to the south & east. The Triborough Bridge, today officially known as the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge, was built in 1936 to connect the 3 boroughs; its 3 spans, all accessible to pedestrians, converge on Randalls Island-Wards Island. If you're walking between the Bronx & Queens, you don't have a choice but to cross the island, as this is the only bridge joining the 2 boroughs that is open to pedestrians (see the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge review). Although the bridge runs across the entire 2 1\/2-km (1 1\/2-mi) length of the island, pedestrians must descend to the ground on arrival on the island, & walk with none-too-interesting scenery until leaving the island on the next span. \n Where the island's beauty really comes forth is when crossing from East Harlem on the shrill-green Wards Island Pedestrian Bridge (1951); walk east on 102nd Street, cross FDR Highway on a pedestrian overpass, & the WIPB will be on your left. You won't regret it - there are scenic views of the Upper East Side, Mill Rock islet, & the southern end of Wards Island. Once on the island, you can't just traipse straight across to the east, because these are the grounds of a gigantic psychiatric hospital which totally dominates the island. Instead turn left, walking northward along the waterside, with utterly enchanting views of the bridge you just crossed, the Manhattan span of the Triborough, & across to Harlem & East Harlem - 2 neighborhoods which might look similar from across the water (both have more than their fair share of \"uglies\" - tall, bland, high-rise rental apartment buildings), but which have a very different character from each other. At the Little Hell Gate, the last remnant of the sound that once separated the 2 islands, don't cross the picturesque wooden footbridge; instead, bear right, & you'll quickly come to the road which runs the length of the island. Or return to Manhattan - if you don't want to walk, there is a bus stop on the road."},{"review":"We biked over from Harlem and down through the park. It was a nice ride. Surreal in the sense that we did not see another living soul from the RFK bridge until we were almost out of the park. 15 minutes of biking in NYC on a Wednesday and 1 pm and not a living person in sight. We were getting a little worried."},{"review":"Great park. Lots of space and pretty easy to get to. Triborough bridge by car and theres even a walkway from 103rd street in Manhattan that contains an FDR Drive overpass and bridge to get to Randalls Island. A lot of things to do. Scenic views of uptown and some bridges including the RFK bridge. Great for a picnic, bike ride of just a stroll. There seems to be a lot of sports going on, such as organized football and soccer going on, especially during the weekend. Very clean too."},{"review":"You access Randall's Island via a footbridge in Manhattan that is at about 102nd St on the Upper East Side. If you take the path to the right, you'll find lots of lawn areas, right on the water, where families come all the time but especially on weekends, to picnic. Just further back from the water is a set of soccer fields, that get regular use. If you take the path to the left, it goes past a garden area, then over a footbridge to a track-and-field stadium. Keep going in that direction and eventually you'll get to a sidewalk that winds around a large complex of baseball\/softball fiends, many of which are also right on the water. I bike this area all the time, and sometimes I am the only person in sight, across acres! What a relief from the human congestion of Manhattan, just 10 minutes from my home. It takes a little exploration to discover how to hook up the circle that connects the left path to the right, but once you do, it's a lot of fun to ride it as a loop."}]},{"nearBy":["Astoria Park","Sutton Place Park","Mannahatta Tours"]}]},{"FuentiduenaChapel.html":[{"address":{"addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"LifeUnderground.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"14th St and 8th Av","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"Was on my way to an engagement, got off the subway car, and stumbled into....

Я, правда, знаю, что раньше Нью-Йоркское метро было еще грязнее, страшнее, и там было довольно опасно. Но в какой-то момент его удалось привести в порядок, что очень здорово. На нем можно быстро перемешаться по городу, станции расположены очень часто - и это удобно. Но все равно остались неудобные, холодные платформы в кафеле, путанная навигация, странные ситуации, когда на какой-то станции открывают двери только пяти передних вагонов (обратите внимание, если поедете смотреть на Статую свободы по линии 1. Об этом объявляет машинист в сильно шуршащий микрофон), когда поезда вдруг проезжают мимо обещанных станций, когда на табло написано, что поезд будет через 5 минут, а он приходит через 25, открывание дверей в разные стороны без предупреждение, и если в поезде биток, вылезти невозможно, иногда поезда едут без анонсов станций, и при этом не имеют табло в вагоне, а также странная традиция по выходным меня местами пути для поездов и писать это на бумажках на столбах - это лишь часть того, с чем я столкнулась всего 3 дня на метро. Так что станции Улица 8 и 14 (это смежные станции разных линий) - хоть какая-то радость. Тут можно побродить и поискать маленькие забавные фигурки. Автор фигурок - американский скульптор Том Оттернесс. Том создал множество мелких бронзовых скульптур и разбросал их по станциям. Сам художник сказал, что эти фигурки символ \"невозможности понять жизнь в Нью-Йорке\". На самом деле очень много сюжетов с фигрками связано с деньгами - кто-то подметает деньги, у кого-то мешок денег вместо головы, при это есть фигурки бомжей, за которыми наблюдает полицейский, и рабочие что-то строящие.\nВзглянув на фото других поняла, что я наша далеко не все. Так что можно устроить целый квест по поиску фигурок. Но, если честно статуи на станции метро Площади Революции в Москве мне кажутся намного круче. Но надеюсь, мэрия Нью-Йорка продолжит работу над улучшением метро, и скоро интересных станций станет больше."},{"review":"Definitely didn't expect to see these!

Since the restoration was so quickly done after the demise of the original building, 60% of the furnishing and 80% of the other artifacts are original to the home. This is a free attraction. Check the NPS website for open days\/dates. Part of the restoration includes making the site more disabled friendly. There is also a small gift shop.

You will be amazed how quickly you leave the city behind and find yourself in the green. \n\nYou can either cross the GWB and ride up the Henry Hudson Drive northbound, all the way to Bear Mountain and further.\n\nAlternatively, you can work your way across the Broadway Bridge into Van Cortlandt Park, where you can pick up the South County & North County trailways, a former railroad converted into a bike \/ hike path, all the way to Brewster and further.\n\nIf you really go for it you can combine the two rides, but that might require a good condition and some extra planning :-)\n\nEnjoy!"},{"review":"This walkway spans the most of the west side of Manhattan. This is an absolute must do when visiting NYC. If you live in NYC, you truly must make it a point to walk this entire Greenway. You get stunning views of the Hudson and New Jersey (it's true!).

We love history but I think it would be interesting to anyone to see - perhaps not really young children who might be bored by it."},{"review":"I was excited and looked forward to seeing the Tutankhamun exhibition at the Melbourne Museum, and I wasn't disappointed. I travelled interstate to Melbourne especially to see it and took my mother along. We were both mesmirised by the beauty and intricate designs of the artifacts, such as jewelly, furniture, ornaments, a guilded coffin, personal items and much more on display. I was very impressed by the number of objects and the background information provided. I appreciated that each display had several duplicated signs in varying sizes making it easy to read and not be blocked by other viewers. Admittedly I was surprised to realise that Tutankhamun's death mask was not on display, but this did not dampen my enthusiasm or enjoyment in seeing all the other artifacts offered. Not having seen this sort of thing before and possibly not ever going to Cairo I appreciated the opportunity to see and be in the presence of such exquisite objects belonging to people of an Age 5000 years ago. Spectacular!!"},{"review":"No Tutankhamun mummy or golden death mask..\nin face not a single major display from Tutankhamun's tomb..\ni've been to a previous mummy exhilaration at the Melbourne museum, and at that time they had a few mummies and even some mummified cats..\nthis is completely a waste of money, and there is nothing that you haven't seen, if you already had the discovery channel..\nwe'd rather save some money and fly to Egypt and see the real deal..\n\nMelbourne Museum, you mislead us all.."},{"review":"After a few negative reviews I thought this Melbourne exhibition deserved one that was a bit more favourable!\n\nWe saw this last weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had been forewarned that the funerary mask was not part of the exhibition, so we didn't have any hopes dashed. (I'm sure it's fairly well-known that the mask, the mummy, and the coffins themselves aren't allowed to leave Egypt, isn't it?) The promotional material now carries a little legend in tiny print \"Image shows canopic coffinette, not funerary mask\". I think the word has spread!\n\nAnyway, the exhibition does contain the gold coffin and funerary mask of at least one other related mummy, and the jewellery, statuettes, and furniture from Tutankhamun's tomb are breath-takingly exquisite. The canopic coffinette itself is rightly given pride of place, and appears to be a perfect minature reproduction of the full-size coffin. How such a thing could be crafted 3,500 years ago is just amazing. I could have pored over it for ages. The fact that everyone thought the picture was of the full-size mask indicates how meticulously beautiful this artefact is.\n\nWe actually enjoyed this exhibition (a little bit) more than Titanic. We spent 3 hours moving through reading the captions (didn't get the audio), but could have been a bit quicker I guess! The suggested 75 minutes wouldn't cut it, though, unless you being harried by bored kids!\n\nA tip: Go early - by mid morning the crowds were really building up (well, we did go on a Saturday - mid week probably isn't so bad.)"},{"review":"We had my family and a friend's family (eight of us) visit the Melbourne Tutankhamun exhibition.\n\nThe kids who are aged 10 - 15 couldn't get to the end fast enough and we as adults tried to enjoy it but found it mostly dull. I was disappointed although not greatly surprised that there was no mummy for viewing and even more surprised that even so much as a replica King Tut mask was not on display.\n\nWe did however go into the adjoining Melbourne Museum and found the displays there to be fantastic. I wished I'd had more time to explore. I was there for three hours but needed at least four.\n\nMy opinion; give the Egypt deal a miss unless you are mad on Egyptian history but definitely go and see the Museum"},{"review":"just been to the Melbourne, Australia exhibition. As described in the other review, dark rooms and poor audio commentary. No real standout objects of great interest. Many seem to be duplicates but this cannot be proven.

I highly recommend it for students and anyone interested in the history of the Middle East and\/or Egypt. The storyboards helped greatly with telling the archaeological story, as well as the historical background of the various treasures displayed. There is also an accompanying audio recording that one can rent at the gate or prior to purchasing tickets that goes into greater detail. The craftsmanship and attention to detail of the clothing, jewelery, and even furniture used by the Pharaohs is exquisite to the point of stunning.

The front row seats about 12 people and you are packed in. No elbow room. If you are claustrophobic this is not the place for you! Restrooms are TINY. Gets warm in the theater very quickly so dress in layers if it's cold outside. Theater staff is friendly. Snacks are available for purchase as well as Blue Man Group items. Merchandise is $$$$.

Maybe rearrange the seating though!?"},{"review":"Once in a while its alright to see a live show in a small theater, especially if the act is the Blue Man Group. High on interaction with the crowd a small theater like the Astor Place gives the audience more ways to literally be part of the show. Blue Man Group as always did not disappoint. I repeat again the size of the theater does make the show better. I only wish it was longer. Here is to Marshmallows, Cereals and toilet paper. :)"},{"review":"Took a large company of high school students to see \"Blue Man Group\", afternoon performance. There is a certain intimacy in the place considering it's size. That was not meant to be a slight. I thought the closeness all around totally added to the enjoyment of the experience. Facilities were quite adequate and even though seating was kind of close, it really didn't matter. Again, part of the fun experience. The performance itself was highly entertaining and the cast's interaction with the audience was hysterical. A truly talented cast, crew and production in a very accommodating venue! Enjoyed it thoroughly."},{"review":"So even though I've seen Blue Man Group several times in Chicago, a few friends in NYC wanted to see it with me, so I bought tickets. I also used my iphone's park whiz app to book parking in advance, which saved me some time. We used that time to look around the theater and learn more about it. Like Chicago's Briar Street Theater, the Astor Place is another Blue Man-only theater,which I suppose is fine, but they played the same sort of show as they did in Chicago, with very little variation. I would understand if it was a normal musical, but no one speaks in Blue Man. After awhile, the novelty of blue dudes banging on drums becomes old hat."},{"review":"With a max of 299 people in the theatre it is the perfect place for the Blue Man group to perform their act and get the audience involved!! Waking off stage even across chairs, gazing into peoples eyes and bringing them on stage for yet another brilliant act this three man act is well worth the visit!\nA great little theatre that makes you feel right in the middle of the act.

From the 80k bricks dinosaur to the Statue of David to the thought-provoking \"hands\". But my fav piece was the head filled with Lego bricks and from which are emerging Lego people signifying the ideas\/creations that are coming out from the artist's imagination! It legalises Lego as art medium. And opens up the mind for others to see beyond just creating cars, houses, bikes and Star Wars Death-Star models!!

We actually held off going as we assumed it was something for kids. How wrong we were. I doubt kids can appreciate the art of this exhibit. This collection of art has been done by a person who was bored in his career as a attorney, so he left his job and took to making Lego art. He has reproduced the great ancient wonders of the world, great paintings by the masters, as well as his own work. It's mind-boggling that such incredible art can be made with a toy that we all grew up with. Doing this art with Lego bricks adds a depth and dimension to the final pieces that is different than it being done with paint, photo, or chalk. This is unlike any other exhibit you've seen.

After leaving the fire museum I checked all the exits in my apartment, smoke detectors, and feel much more prepared in the event I'm ever in a fire."},{"review":"This is probably one of our favourite small little museums we've been to. A very interesting collection, well worth visiting."},{"review":"Our family can't tell you about the Museum. We just chose a Fire Station on the East Side in Manhattan. Walked up to the closed door and rang the doorbell. Firefighter Nick appeared, opened the big doors (the engine and ladder truck were on a call), and answered our questions for 10-15 minutes. Try it - you'll like it."},{"review":"This is without doubt the best small museum I have ever visited. From the time you walk upstairs to look at exhibits covering the early years of the New York Fire Department's history there is no end to the fascinating stories and anecdotes accompanying the pieces you can see. It is one of those places where you linger at every exhibit and continually learn new things. On the whole, the tone is bright and occasionally humourous. However, the tone darkens considerably downstairs when you enter the memorial exhibition to the 343 firefighters who died on 9\/11. It is a harrowing and moving exhibition that brought me close to tears on a number of occasions. I would advise people who have the time to visit this before going to the 9\/11 Memorial as it does a marvellous job of putting it in context. This is a museum that is a little obscure but deserves to be filled to the rafters for its sheer excellence. An absolute must see."},{"review":"As a volunteer firefighter I thought this would be an excellent stop. It was a bunch of older stuff that has been used in firefighting, not necessarily in NYC. It was neat to see the old apparatus's they had but to be honest I wouldn't go back...or even wouldn't have gone if I would have known what they had on display."},{"review":"Before visiting the museum, I was worried that visiting as a solo adult I might stand out a bit, however now I have been, the museum seems very much aimed at adults. There are costumes and hats for children, but nothing else was particularly interactive. \n\nIt was interesting to learn the history of the FDNY and see the old fire engines and equipment. There are lots of things to read. The 9\/11 memorial is large, with photographs of all the firefighters that lost their lives and is placed in a nice light filled atrium. \n\nThe museum was a lot smaller than I expected and I was in the museum about an hour. It is inexpensive to visit at $8, so I didn't mind. The museum shop is large, with lots of FDNY branded goods for sale."},{"review":"We visited the Fire Museum on Spring Street and what a place. The are fire engines that are over 100 yrs old, uniforms, paintings, badges, hats and a gorgeous drink punch set. They also have up to date videos how they fire fight nowadays. There is a private room to commemorate 9\/11 and it is very emotional.\nIt really is worth a visit if you are in town."},{"review":"We went to the museum on the urging of my nephew. We were not sure if we would have time but went as we were leaving the city to the Holland tunnel(locate a few block away). I was not sure what to expect or if I would find it interesting. I was pleasantly surprised! The museum provided a rich history of firefighting from its earliest inception of organized fire fighting. The museum had displays of equipment as well as early fire wagons and pumpers. The museum also had a touching display of items from 9-11 and after. I was glad I took the time to visit and would recommend to anyone who has an interest in firefighting."},{"review":"As my boyfriend is a firefighter I thought this would be great and enjoyable. It was ok and some things were better than others. He asked if there was a discount for other firefighters and was told no. I thought this was a shame as we were here supporting the place. We wouldn't have gone if he weren't a firefighter. \nThe staff were very friendly. They have a great selection of gifts and such- especially for children. There is also a memorial area for 9\/11."}]},{"nearBy":["Art Children's Museum","Children's Museum of the Arts","Hudson Street"]}]},{"WalkingTours(126).html":[{"reviews":[]},{"nearBy":[]}]},{"DialogInTheDark.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"11 Fulton Street","postalCode":"10038","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"If you have some time to spare from the \"must sees\" in visiting New York, then this is definitely something you should try!

It offers a great perspective into the life of the visually challenged. This is an experience of a lifetime.\n\nYou are basically led into series of rooms which are completely dark, you cannot see a thing here. Along the way you are guided by a guide who is surprisingly blind. You are led through series of rooms which are simulated to feel like various NY things such as central park, a kitchen, subway ride, street, etc. You will have to rely on your other senses to move through them and in the end you have a dialogue with your guide about the experience. \n\nIt is situated right next to the Bodies The Exhibition. If you are short on time or can only visit one, then skip the bodies exhibition and visit this place."},{"review":"Wow, this was an experience, it was hard at some parts.

Blind or visually impaired individuals you through the \"sites of NYC\" -- while in complete darkness. Basically, you experience NYC as though you were visually impaired or blind. (Note: This is an exhibit. You are not walking through the actual streets of NYC.) Our tour guide, Pedro, was wonderful - he was welcoming, informative, and he was so willing to talk with us and share his own personal experiences. I highly recommend this exhibit for anyone who has the opportunity to go."},{"review":"My friend and I had the opportunity to take this tour. It was an enlightening, humbling and awakening experience. Visit if you have the chance. It's worth the money for this one."},{"review":"I had heard about this from a friend of a friend and it sounded interesting. My 12 year old son looked it up online and requested to go during summer break. I was surprised to learn it's been around for over 20 years and in about 30 countries. I'm amazed I hadn't heard of this before.\n\nWhat an extraordinary experience! I'm really surprised there isn't more hype about this exhibit. They didn't seem to be very busy, so I didn't buy the tickets beforehand, and that worked out fine - it was just me and my two tween kids on our tour - and we were still bumped into each other. Stephanie led us through the streets and subways of New York City, her voice, and our canes, guiding us. It was a great way to connect with my kids and encourage them to be more empathetic people, especially when they heard Stephanie's story. I'm sure every guide's story is just as tragic and thought provoking. \n\nI highly recommend this exhibit: kids over the age of 5 and up - I would even like to take my parents (in their 70's) to experience this. Great for out of town guests when they visit, etc."},{"review":"I moved to NYC over a year ago and thought this might just be another tourist trap, but WOW was I wrong. I've never been more excited to be so wrong. I went with my boyfriend around 3:15 on a Saturday afternoon, and we lucked out in being the only two people on this specific tour. We walked into a holding area and took a seat on some lit up boxes and waited as the lights dimmed out. We were left in total darkness. I started to get a bit nervous, but just at this time Frank Senior walked into our room and all of the unease vanished. Frank has the voice of liquid gold and the capacity to quell all anxieties within fifteen seconds. I felt immediately 'ok' with the adventure we were getting ready to go on.\n\nAfter exchanging pleasantries we started our tour of NYC. We visited a couple of awesome places and were required to rely solely on our sense of smell, touch and hearing. It was amazing how quickly you start to feel comfortable in your new environment when you are able to access all of your other senses. Whenever I felt myself becoming unsure or freezing in place, Frank would miraculously appear and take hold of my hand to guide me back to the correct location. I think Frank was a bat in another life with his sonar like ears. \n\nWe spent an hour wandering the \"sights\" and sounds of NYC and finally meandered our way into a comfortable place to sit and learn more about Frank. No questions were off limits, and we really left with such a great understanding (and a well needed dose of respect) for the visually impaired. \n\nI've never cherished the gift of sight more than after our tour with Frank. I had a very difficult time falling asleep that night - my mind raced a million miles a minute with my newly found appreciations. \n\nI am 100% bringing all of my visiting guests to this attraction - but only to Frank Senior. Thank you SO much for making this such an amazing adventure for us, and one Dan and I will be talking about for years to come!\n\n-Ashley (from NC)"},{"review":"I took the subway to the Fulton St stop and walked about 10 blocks to find that the entire block on that side of the street is boarded up with a plywood barrier.

It is music, dancing and singing which are all great things. The execution could have been better. I will start with the sound system which is just horrible. Why bother getting a group of great musicians if you are going to use speakers that sound like they belong in my 1983 Honda civic. The sound system is inexcusable; you can see the musicians right in front of you yet the sound seems to be coming from the right of the stage along with some echo and distortion. The speakers are not capable of reproducing some of the higher violin notes and so those sounds come from the stage. The show incorporates both tango and modern dance. I am familiar with ballroom dancing so I was surprised when the least talented of the couples dancing would receive the most applause. My wife later explained that this particular couple had been on American television and were somewhat famous. The guest singer was Luis Enrique who was excellent. If the theatre hires a sound engineer to go and update their sound system this show could have been phenomenal. As it is, the poor quality of the sound just ruins it for the rest of the performers which are really very good. This particular theatre is small enough that if you just turn off the microphones and amplification you can still hear the music and it would have sounded better."},{"review":"I love watching anything involving the Argentine Tango.

On our visit, the church had a warm feeling to it and was obviously in regular use. Not only was it open regularly for its parishioners, the authorities were more than happy to permit photography as long as we promised to send them some of the photos!\n\nIn 1895, Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848\u20131933) was commissioned to design and install the seven great apse windows above the High Altar, representing St Michael\u2019s Victory in Heaven. These windows are considered to be amongst the finest compositions in American favrile glass (an iridescent glass, where the colour is ingrained in the glass itself, as well as having a distinctive colouring). In 1920, Tiffany completed the Witness of the Redemption reredos in the Chapel of the Angels \u2013 one of his most important ecclesiastical mosaics. Flanking the mosaic are two Tiffany sanctuary lamps, made from \u2018turtle back\u2019 glass (because of their resemblance to the curved top shell of a turtle). The Tiffany windows in the Chapel of the Angels are particularly interesting for their use of the plating technique and drapery glass. Whilst Tiffany may not have invented plating, he used it to perfection to create depth, shadows and contours. (Plating (sometimes called layering or overlays) refers to the soldering together of two or more layers of glass to create depth and contrasts in colours). Drapery glass refers to a sheet of heavily folded glass that suggests fabric folds. Tiffany made abundant use of drapery glass in ecclesiastical stained glass windows to add a three dimensional effect to flowing robes and angel wings.\n\nSt Michael's Church represent one of the largest Tiffany installations still intact in its original setting and should not be missed!"},{"review":"Um igreja bem bonita com um estilo único.

I opted for the 3rd row orchestra for the most recent show--more about that in a minute--but most seats will probably offer a good view. Certainly, any seat in the orchestra section and the first rows of the mezzanine will prove quite satisfactory.\n\nI didn't know it, but the St. James is actually located on the site of the original Sardi's restaurant! It's builder first owned it, but the theater later found its way into the Astor family and several other owners.\n\nLike most Broadway theaters, those with long legs should select an aisle seat. Doors are open for performances at least 1\/2 hour before the show begins. Drinks and snacks at regular Broadway prices (expensive) are available before the opening number and during intermission. The rest rooms are downstairs. Don't dilly-dally and chat during intermission if you must use the facilities as there is likely to be a long line!\n\n\"Something Rotten\" is the current feature and it is well worth the price of admission ($150 per ticket for 3rd row orchestra). I like to be within \"spitting distance\" because it makes one almost feel as though you are part of the show--and this one is ripe with laughs, great songs and big dance numbers that really rip when you are that close to the performers!\n\nThe story goes something like this: The scene is 1590s England and William Shakespeare is a rock star achieving success after success with his plays--much to the chagrin of the Bottom brothers--Nick and Nigel--who can never seem to write a hit play of their own. \n\nDriven to despair when their patron pulls out of the Bottoms' latest production, Nick takes the family savings and spends it on a soothsayer who is tasked with divining the Bard's most famous hit that the Bottoms can use as the basis for their new play. Nostradamus--the seer (not THE Nostradamus, but A Nostradamus) peers into the future and, instead of predicting \"Hamlet,\" he misinterprets the signs and comes up with \"Omelet,\" which is destined to become the very first musical ever produced. The fun proceeds from there with dancing eggs, condemnations from the Puritans and other shenanigans!\n\nThe cast is great. Kate Reinders is also in this musical farce, but she doesn't have many songs to sing--a pity as it is always a treat to hear her perform. \n\nIf you know someone who has never been to a Broadway play, this is the one to bring them to. They'll be hooked forever!\n\nStanding \"O\" was well-deserved!\n\nFinal tidbit: The movie \"Birdman\" was filmed almost entirely in the St. James Theatre!"},{"review":"Saw Something Rotten! here and has such a great time!

We arrived in NYC on Friday afternoon, went straight to the St. James and ordered tickets for \"Something Rotten.\" The theater itself is absolutely beautiful, with ample and comfortable seating. We got there early, skipped buying the somewhat pricey wine and water and all, and completely enjoyed what I consider one of the funniest musicals I have ever seen. When we returned from our cruise nine days later, my lovely wife said she would consider seeing the show again - but not for the $170 per ticket we spent the first time. We got in line outside the theater at 10 a.m. to get rush tickets at $35 each. The box office does not open until noon on Sunday - the website lies in that regard, so if you are expecting it to open at 11 a.m. on Sunday, wait to get into line until about 11. Two hours is a long wait. The rush tickets are obstructed view, but well worth every cent you save (which we used to buy wine this time).

If you're going focused on the art on display check what that will be before going. When we went the whole rotunda was dedicated to one artist; and I'll have to admit not one I related to all that well. Of course, if you're only in New York for a short visit you're stuck with what's on display (as we were) so you make the best of it or skip it. That said, the permanent display of impressionist works etc. is worth a visit in and of itself. The docents are very helpful and friendly and easy to find. I appreciated being able to delve a little more into the artworks and artist featured when we visited in conversation with these docents.\n\nWe were quite disappointed in the Frank Lloyd Wright display in the basement.

The doors were supposed to open at 9, but they were 30 minutes late. The show finally began at 10. There was a long queue though and if you didn't reach by 8.45ish, you wouldn't get good seats. Tickets are 8 dollars apiece on Wednesdays. The place itself is small (seating capacity ~90). There is a bar with some stools and standing space and rows of seats closer to the mic. \n\nThe host was hilarious and he set the atmosphere for the night. Around 20 poets came up to perform 200 seconds of poetry each. Most poems were about identity (primarily racial and sexual, some economic and religious) and it was great to understand from people themselves how these issues really play out in American society. As a tourist, this isn't something I noticed while visiting any of the highly spoken about attractions in New York.\n\nI'd highly recommend a visit to Nuyorican if you want something different, earthy, thought-provoking, raw and fun!"},{"review":"Nurican Cafe is legendary amongst those who like spoken work poetry venues. The poets performing during my recent visit were good, but I have seen better. I'm sure the talent changes on a regular basis, so it's the luck of the draw unless you go to see a specific headliner.\n\nInitially, I was thrown by how disorganized and seriously over-crowded the place was. So crowded that I expected the NYPD to shut the place down at any moment. There was no seating, hardly a place to stand without someone stepping on your feet....just very uncomfortable. The MC started everything about 1 hour late, so that did not help the situation.\n\nWithout warning....after the first performer, half the crowd left and there was a decent amount of space in the venue. I hear this is often the case. If you wait through the early crowd -- or better yet come a late-- the crowd is more manageable. I'm not sure if this would be the case with a famous performer, but I would definitely try to avoid the early crowd if possible."},{"review":"We went to open mic night on a Saturday night.

My sister dragged me to this spot on a Friday night because she says that she loves it. I just thought it was OK.\nFor one, The place is pretty small and basic. Also, if your going on a weekend night be prepared for a very long line. According to my sister the price changes often depending on the show but it supposedly always stays under 20 bucks. \nI personally had an issue with how the line was managed. Because after paying our entrance fee we entered the cafe to find that all seats were filled so only the option to stand was left. It would've been courteous to let the people still waiting on line outside know that they'd have to stand or sit on the floor before they paid the full amount and entered. But of course this courtesy wasn't given. \nThe poets were incredibly talented but the judging process could definitely be improved. Randomly selecting judges just doesn't seem fair to me-how do you know these are not friends of a performer? \nThere's was also a bar on premises but I didn't order anything so I cant speak on that topic. The crowd the night I went seemed to be made up of alot of skunky smelling twenty somethings-Or maybe it was just the section I was in? One girl was so high she could barely stand, walked right into me repeatedly until her friends (who definitely saw my patience was wearing very thin) finally sat her down on the floor. \nI would return in the future but I would definitely inquire about what seating is left before paying my entrance fee because that information is definitely not volunteered."},{"review":"We had heard great things about Nuyorican through the Melbourne, Australia slam poetry scene and so made a visit a highlight of our NYC trip.\n\nThe venue was fabulous - small and cramped but oh so much fun! Get there early or reserve a seat online. The line started forming for walk-up tickets over an hour before doors open and not everyone gets in so don't arrive on time and expect a seat. \n\nUnreserved seats are standing room only so be prepared to squash in tight on the floor.\n\nGreat music, a good bar setup and high energy atmosphere. Loud, jumpy, and outspoken. Wonderful poets and spoken word artists. This is not a show to sit and watch passively. \n\nMC Mahogany did a brilliant job involving the audience - be prepared to be an active participant! You will not be able to sit quietly! We danced, yelled, clapped and cheered. \n\n Loved it and would definitely come again."},{"review":"A friend of mine suggested we check out Nuyorican for a show.

The venue is very small, with limited seating at the bar as well. Patrons are welcome to sit on the floor in front of the stage. \n\nFirst off, the hostess, Mahogany Browne is quite entertaining, just too real! We were disappointed that we didn\u2019t get to hear her \u201Cspit\u201D. She made new-comers feel welcome, and visiting \u201Cstates\u201D and boroughs got a shout-out. The DJ was great too. The music satisfied everyone from the very young to those not-so-young, like us. The bar only serves beer or wine, so if you\u2019re into heavier spirits, you\u2019ll have to get that elsewhere. \n\nVenessa Marco headlined the poetry slam, and she was amazing! The vibe of the café is very interactive, with the volunteer audience members (various ages, cultures, and backgrounds) voting on each of the poets. Be warned, the audience will \u201Cboo\u201D if they disagree with the score, though. On this Friday night, the all-female team of finalists was prepping for the national poetry slam in Oakland, CA. they were really quite good.

We walked up 2 flights of stairs and down a small hallway into a waiting room which included a large bar and a few places to sit and wait. Once inside the theatre, I noticed that it reminded me of a small, old fashioned movie theatre. It holds about 130-150 people.

Not good!\n\nIt was my great fortune that the MTC was previewing its fine new play, The Country House, on this Sunday evening. It reminded me of all the wonderful plays I've seen over the years that have been produced by this bunch.\n\nThis play opens the first week of October. Don't miss it. The remarkable Blythe Danner stars. Donald Margulies wrote it, and Daniel Sullivan directed. The rest of the cast does superb work. It's set to be one of the most compelling dramas of the season.\n\nIt sure made me realize why I can't stay away from the stage here for so long!"},{"review":"My friend and I bought tickets for Broadway's 2 for 1 week and decided to see The Country House on its opening night of previews. I have never seen a show so \"new\" to the stage before and I was pleasantly surprised with how well the cast did considering it was their first performance with an audience. \n\nBlythe Danner is a class act and it was more than a treat to see her on stage live. That said, the whole cast did a great job. Sarah Steele, who plays Susie, the youngest of the characters, was a show stopper - amazing delivery, sarcastic, to the point, blunt yet relatable. Daniel Sunjata, likely best known now for his lead role on the TV series Graceland, was perfect as the lust interest of pretty much all women in the play (and beyond). But truly, hats off to Eric Lange, his role as Elliot - the uncle\/son (depending on perspective) who is so caught up in his own less successful life that he brings the family down and is tirelessly focused on the negative. He plays his part so powerfully, and so emotionally raw, I commend him. \n\nThe story is about family love, loss, success, failure, fame and fortune. Set in the Berkshires, near Williamstown, MA, the play takes you right into the lives of this one family as it copes with the recent passing of one of their own along with the drama that naturally follows life in the theater. I highly suggest seeing this show while it is on Broadway."},{"review":"When We Were Young andUnafraid by Sarah Treem is a complex work set in 1972 on an island off thecoast of Seattle. At the dawn of the Roev. Wade decision privatizing a woman\u2019s right to abortion, the setting is theunseen sixth character in this play. Agnes (Cherry Jones) resonates withallusion to the lamb (Agnes of God) and Jones\u2019 former starring role as SisterAloysius in Doubt, another ManhattanTheatre Club performance.\n \nAlthough Agnes runs a rooming house, we learn it is also asafe house for abused women. The three supporting female actors: Hannah, MaryAnne, and Penny roughly represent feminism, the abused wife, and the incipientwoman in her rebellious teenage years.\n \nTreem\u2019s writing exaggerates each character\u2019s flaws leavingthe audience to ponder why they are written in extremes rather than a morenuanced development. Mary Anne, the abused wife (Zoe Kazan), counsels Penny(Morgan Saylor) in the art of seduction of the captain of the football team. Itis unclear why Mary Anne\u2019s marriage took a turn for the worse except for abrief reference to her husband\u2019s stint in Viet Nam. She also puts herself andeveryone else in danger by calling her husband when she is granted asylum fromhis violence. It seems she is complicit in her own destruction.\n \nNo matter what Penny, a defiant sixteen-year-old, sees andhears in this home, she is bound and determined to run off with a boy fromschool. The silence about her experience leaves much to the imagination of theviewer as she asks Agnes to wake her for school the following day.\n \nHannah, the ultimate feminist, is a caricature, as sheclimbs through a window declaring she is a revolutionary who finds an enclavewhere males are banned completely.\n \nThe only male is a roomer named Paul (Patch Darragh) whosemild and meek exterior borders on the violent as well in his brief dallianceencouraged by Mary Anne.\n \nIt is Agnes\u2019 characterization that is believably developedinto a mothering, wise woman with reasons for what she is doing and why she isdoing it. As in every role, Jones is a very convincing May pole to thesupporting actors who play out their self-destruction around her. The show willkeep the viewer interested in its numerous scenes separated by black-outs wherebits and pieces of each character\u2019s motives and actions are revealed within thetwo acts. Ed said he could not relate to any of the characters; however, thisis indeed a woman\u2019s play that explores the universals of self-determination,commitment, and decency. It is two and a half hours well spent."},{"review":"I was at City Center last night and saw \"THE MOST DESERVING\" Very enjoyable in Stage 2. Put on by the Women's Project.

On top of that, there were massive rumors that their shallow grave burials were the reason for diseases running rampant in the City.

To alleviate the problem, Trinity purchased a large track of land west of Broadway and North of 155th St. The 1811 Commission which established NYC\u2019s GRID (Avenues North-South and Streets East-West divided by 5th Ave) stopped at 155th Street: it was everybody\u2019s opinion at the time that it would take centuries to build that far.

Plots in the Western part were much more expensive, because they had the best views of Hudson. Since prior to parks, cemeteries were routinely used as \u201Coutdoor space\u201D for the family to enjoy nature and views, it was important that they could visit a dear departed and enjoy the views at the same time\u2026Not to mention the fact that the residents needed good views, too!\n Trinity Cemetery is still active and non-denominational. The views are gorgeous and you can spend days reading the stories, thinking of the people behind them and admiring the symbolism and iconography of the tombs. . Pick a map in the office but keep in mind it\u2019s not very precise. \n I was greatly surprised by the simplicity of the Astor vault. John Jacob Astor, who made his fortune in fur trade, then in real estate and who, asked on his dying bed if regretted anything said, \u201CI wish I had bought more land\u201D, actually owned a huge chunk on the Island of Manhattan as well as in several other places. His is a modest white obelisk with one word: ASTOR. \n Audubon lies in the Eastern part (his estate was adjacent to the Cemetery, he bought the land at the time when the Church did theirs). Whoever designed his obelisk, must have had a grim sense of humor: of all the birds Audubon painted (\u201CBirds of America\u201D made him a great deal of money so he could afford a large parcel of land by the Hudson), they picked a vulture to be closest to his portrait\u2026 Audubon was an avid hunter: he would shoot the bird, pin it carefully, so he can paint it, then cook and eat it, practicing an early form of recycling, I guess. \n Madame Jumel, the daughter of a prostitute and herself not far from that profession, only on a higher scale, married more than once, her last one being the murderer of Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr. She traveled to France and back and turned so many tricks that eventually she died the richest woman in America at 90. Her tomb is hidden behind a rotten iron gate, they say it was broken into years ago\u2026The Morris-Jumel mansion which was General Washington\u2019s headquarters during the War is not far from here, you might find it interesting to learn more about Madame Jumel. And how she had a boy tall and handsome, just like the general...\n Mayor Koch had picked his plot (in the Eastern part) and had even designed his own stone in advance: it states something to the effect that he was of the Jewish faith but he loved all the people of New York\u2026\n When you come out of the Cemetery, you might wish to take a look at Audubon Terrace (it\u2019s on the Western side of Broadway). If it\u2019s Sunday, you can visit the Hispanic Society of America (separate review). To get uptown, take the M3 us and get off at 155th St. The entrance to the Cemetery is from 155th West or East of Broadway, depending on which part you want to explore.\n-----------"},{"review":"Beautiful grounds and a peaceful setting.

The 20$ gave us a full day at the natural history museum."},{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"It is true that recently, numerous tourists want to visit Gospel churchs and that can be annoying for locals. However, that never justifies an obligatory 20$ charge to enter a church. \n\nThis is the problem with Mount Neboh: they wait at the very last moment to \"inform\" you that the donation is 20$. You wait in line for an hour, but no one is going to inform you that it costs 20$. They wait at 10h45, when all the churches around started their mass, to tell you that: 1) either you enter and encourage robbery, or 2) go away and lose your whole morning. Yes, some churchs can ask more from tourists, like 3$-5$ for some very nice installations. But 20$ is a total ripoff. This is a donation: if I have to pay 20$, sell tickets. \n\nGoing somewhere that will laugh at me because I am not a local??\n\nI put 10$ in the basket. The lady took it in less than a second and gave it back to me, insisting that my donation has to me 20$ or more, and that I have to go away if I don't pay that amount.\n\nI work in the tourism industry, and let me give you one advice: find another church. Find a church that is not a business, that has principles. 2 minutes way from there, First Corinthian Baptist Church (1912 Adam Clayton Powell Junior Boulevard) is nice, as well as Canaan Baptist Church of Christ (132 West 116th Street). They let you give what you want. We were 3 groups and we all tried a different mass (the three churches mentionned). Everything was more or less the same, except for the price."},{"review":"Never been in a Gospel service, I saw the service on TV so I went to experience by myself.. it says that it is free, but when you reach the door, they ask for 20 dollars donation!!!, I thought that donation is what you can give or what you want to donate... it was full of tourists, we were seated in the second floor, it was like a balcony, no air condition, and i was really afraid that that balcony will fall because the amount of people that visited the place, it was a very long service, after one hour we left the place."},{"review":"My experience was similar to the other reviewers. A very long line, and maybe 45-minute wait to get into the church for the 11am service. Be warned that now they insist that every single person \"donates\" $20 (yes, you read it correctly, TWENTY DOLLARS). They don't tell you that until you reach the door and even ask you to give a $20 bill exactly. WOW, what a rip-off, in my opinion. It's like any other tourist attraction now. I counted the number of tourists in the balcony and estimated that the church must have raked in well over $5,000 for that one service in tourist donations. Gee whiz! By the way, there were far more tourists there than the actual congregation.\n\nI was allotted a very poor seat in the back row of the balcony and couldn't see a thing. Photos are not allowed, by the way; if they see you taking a picture, a man comes over to tell you to put your camera away. \n\nAs far as the service goes, the choir was nice, but if you go to a proper gospel concert, the music is even better. The sermon was on \"The Lord's Prayer\" and the reverend did the fire and brimstone style, talking heatedly about \"being led into temptation\" and \"being delivered from evil.\" Real Baptist style of preaching, which was interesting. I don't know if he was the regular preacher or not. The whole service lasted over 2 hours. Halfway through, I managed to sneak downstairs on the pretext of getting one of their free paper fans (furnished by a local funeral parlor!) and managed to convince an usher to let me sit downstairs in back of the main sanctuary, which was much more interesting and better visibility of the congregation and the choir. It was an extremely hot day and there was apparently no air-conditioning, a fact which the reverend alluded to in his appeal not to let ourselves burn in hell !\n\nI would highly recommend walking around Harlem a bit before or after the service. There is a little African market nearby and some other sites. Harlem seems to have climbed out of its previous reputation as a dangerous and dirty place, and I found it quite enjoyable to stroll around the neighborhood. People at the church and all around were very friendly."},{"review":"Went under our own steam on New Year's morning. Wanted to join service proper rather than be part of tour group. Decided on Mount N as we thought it did not admit tour groups. Arrived early and asked to enter church but very pleasantly advised that as we were not members of the congregation we would have to queue and be admitted after 4 tour buses - policy on tours has apparently changed. However we were art the front of the queue and everyone arriving was very friendly and wished us Happy New Year. We were eventually admitted to the balcony with a restricted view of the altar . Sadly the first tour bus got the best seats! We were \"asked\" to contribute $10 per person on admittance - which by my calculations meant an income of over $3000 for the one service. That said I am sure they will put the money to good use. The service and singing was amazing and very moving. An experience we will never forget."},{"review":"We decided to visit Mt. Neboh, rather than Abyssinian Baptist, the most famous of all the Harlem Churches. I was raised Baptist and I was in town visiting with friends who wanted to attend a Sunday service with me. If you don't know it, all the major black churches have many tourist who want to attend a service while in NYC. Consequently, they arrive by the tour bus load at the major churches. I don't know what the arrangements are but there is some financial benefit to the church that allow the tours. Deservedly so of course, as these group put a heck of a lot of wear and tear on the church building itself. At Mt. Neboh, as there is at Abyssinian, there is a special area for tourist\/visitors. You have to understand that they have no choice but to do this because if they allowed all the tourist to sit in the main sanctuary, there would be no room for the regular members...and tourist leave in the middle of the service too. At Mt. Neboh, tourist are taken to the balcony where there are three rows of elevated seats allowing visitors a fairly good view of what is happening below. We did not go as part of a tour, so we were asked to wait in line until the people on the tour were seated. We were assured that we would be seated however. The church is lovely and a good sized one. The pulpit and choir areas are spacious and set so you can see it well from most any vantage point.\n\nThe morning we went, 2\/20\/2011, the service was good although I was hoping for great, but I'll get to that in a moment. There was a special tribute dance put on by the youth of the church and other activities acknowledging Black History Month. What I can only assume was the \"Junior Choir\" sang and I believe the sermon was given by either a visiting pastor or an associate pastor. At any rate, my point is, on this particular Sunday, neither the regular pastor, Dr. Green, nor the regular choir sang. From reviews I have read the choir is outstanding. So yes, it was a bit disappointing in that sense. However, it was my fault, as I should have checked the church calendar to see what would be happening at the church. Pastors and their choirs will often travel to other churches both in and out of state to help the other church celebrate anniversaries, etc, so having the regular minister and the choir away is very common in Baptist Churches. The associate pastor sang a beautiful song before she began her sermon. \n\nI would suggest you check with the church or their website to make sure the Pastor and full choir will be in attendance on the date you plan to attend if your goal is to hear good gospel music and enjoy the full Black Baptist Church Experience. The deacons and ushers are all very welcoming and you are made to feel welcome in their church home. You should know and be aware that this is first and foremost, a worship service and not a show that is put on for the benefit of tourists. So above all, please dress and act with respect. If you have time, afterwards, find a place to have some good soul food after the service in Harlem. Here's another biggie...if you can, stay for the full service. The bus tours usually take their people out about halfway through the service, basically after the choir sings. Let me tell you, if you've come this far, and if you can stay for the sermon. You will never forget hearing a sermon preached by an accomplished minister. After the tour busses leave, you can usually get further to the front in the visitors area and have an even better view of what's going in down below.\n\nI have friends who have been present at Mt. Neboh and I'm told their regular services are as good as any, including Abyssinian Baptist...and you may find Mt. Neboh a bit easier to get into. Whatever you do and wherever you go, I wish you a joyful experience in the black churches of Harlem."},{"review":"Avevo letto buone recensioni su alcuni articoli sul web.

It's free to enter and if you want to walk around rather than sit, the entire thing can be done in less than an hour. \n5th Ave traffic flows downtown so for tourists, I would suggest, if you have a New York Pass and therefore a Gray Line New York City Sightseeing bus ticket, do the Uptown Tour, and after seeing Harlem get off at the Museum of the City of New York (the stops are clearly announced). This stop is right outside the Garden and near to the aforementioned Museum and the Guggenheim. If you're a good walker you could even stroll down to the Met (or the Smithsonian, or the Frick) afterwords. Less able walkers can just step back onto the open-top bus at the stop they got off, and be taken back to Times Square.\nA note for bird enthusiasts- while the rest of the park is naturally a haven for dozens of species, the Garden, right up until migration season at the start of autumn, is home to wild hummingbirds, attracted by the flowers.

The windows are themed Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love. There are live performances, but my favorite was not a live performance, but an animatronic, metal and salvaged parts, fantastical steam punk, six and a half foot tall Owl in the Truth window. He speaks to you in a melodious, deep and soothing voice. It is truly a fantastic sight. Adults and kids should both enjoy this very ingenious display. After seeing the window consider shopping in Barneys if you are a hedge fund manager or have hit the lottery. Otherwise you might want to look elsewhere for shopping. The store is lovely but extremely expensive. The exception may be the Baz Dazzled themed gifts, which are in the realm of affordable (some less then $100) and could make a very nice gift. The windows at Bergdorfs are beautiful, but Baz Dazzled is a one of a kind event."},{"review":"Barney's holiday windows are absolutely incredible!!

It's a don't miss if you are coming into New York anytime between Thanksgiving and Christmas. One of the few free attractions worth making time for.

Friendly bar staff and great sound system for a smaller venue. \n\nUpstairs is a nice little cupcake and other treat shop. Most of the goodies are vegan, but fret not, you can't tell the difference. The brownie with almonds is like biting into the sun--if it were chocolate, covered with almonds, and not hot enough to melt your face. These brownies are kept refrigerated, but they will melt your tastebuds. Try a couple different cupcakes while you're there, too. Heck, you'll walk it off later. You're in New York.

We were just interested in lunch so paid no attention to all the commercial space. There are two eating choices - on the first floor it was a variety of stations with French food with the added bonus of an actual restaurant where you could order and sit at a table - we were outside so had a great view of the river and surrounding area. Upstairs there is another venue of food choices - but I wouldn't call this a food court - it's much nicer than that.

Easy to reserve tickets. Dates for tapings comes up on Anderson Live Website about a month in advance. On the day I reserved there were two tapings. Unfortunately I was given the 9am taping which requires you to be at the studio at 7am sharp. Kind of early to leave the hotel at 6:15am to walk to the studio. But the brisk walk woke us up so we would be looking our best on live TV. There is a process you have to go through as there is security, seating and production warmup. It was an enjoyable experience to see what goes on behind the scenes of a taping of a show. Also the time during the commercials is lots of fun and laughter with the interaction of the studio audience. And of course it was nice to see Anderson Cooper in person. He is such a nice person and comes across as very down to earth regular kind of guy.

We saw the Richard Estes exhibit which was terrific and spent most of our almost three hour visit on this floor. It ends September 30, 2015 so try to catch it.\n\nAlso interesting was the mannequin exhibit by Ralph Pucci which ends October 25. However, this only takes about 20 minutes. \n\nThe museum offers free audio guides which use the iPhone. At first it was confusing because the audio does not stop between pictures\/displays etc. so it is difficult to get from one display to another in time to hear the description from the beginning and it was a pain to keep turning it on and off or look for the particular item being talked about. The tape always begins with the display by the elevator yet you are encouraged to use the stairs which is around the corner from the elevator. (You start on the 6th floor using the elevator and work your way down). Also, it is quite possible that the iPhone's battery will go dead while listening to it. In spite of these issues, the audio guide was worthwhile. There was also a free guided tour being given which we overheard (they are quite noisy) and it sounded interesting but it was very short and if you enjoyed the tour, you'd have to go back and explore on your own. \n\nThey are closed on Mondays and if you go on Thursday evenings, it's pay what you want. Otherwise the admission is about $16 and there is a senior discount."},{"review":"Unless you are going at the one short time (Thursday evenings?) when admission is free, skip this attraction unless you absolutely cant think of anything to do.

New York has so many wonderful things to see, we were sorry we wasted time here.\n\nTHere is a restaurant on an upper floor with a decent view - pretty pricey for not being a particularly well known food spot with all the great choice in NYC. we went in and there was no one eating in it..we looked at the menu and left."}]},{"nearBy":["Roundabout Theatre Company","The Shops at Columbus Circle","Time Warner Center"]}]},{"AmericanMerchantMarinesMemorial.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"Battery Park","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"I enjoy art and sculptures.

I was hooked and walked in to check it out. It got better and better. The flowers(Mums) were gorgeous! The locust trees provided shade. With three levels of seating, I chose the lower area right in front of the noisy falls. While nestled between the falls and another flower bed behind me, the City disappeared from my thoughts.

It covers a broad range of topics from banking to history to investing. Visitors are presented with a number of facts, like an item that cost one dollar in 1975 costs about four dollars today, the market advances about 10 pct on average per year, and an explanation of various investment instruments. The video of intervies with people on the trading floor and what they do and how they do it was particularly interesting. When you leave you'll know more than when you came.\n\nHowever, this place is old school. Didactic. Too much to read. Too many periods and not enough question marks. Unengaging and not thought provoking. Given the poor state of financial literacy we need better.\n\nEven the labels have issues. One exhibit has text on glass. The back wall, behind exhibits, has thin vertical stripes the same width and color as the front text. This belongs in the visual perception gallery at NY hall of science. Visitors shouldnt have to move their head back and forth to make out the characters.\n\nThey quote Warren Buffet as preaching finding good values. How to do this? How do you compare what you pay vs what you get when you buy something? Is a share of one company at $35 a better value than another at $40? What about earnings? What about a gallon of gas at $4? What about admission to moaf?\n\nThey could do so much more. How about present us with some facts (like real past stock data) and ask us to make a purchase decision and show what happened? How about help people understand the difference between fact based purchases and emotion? How to evaluate performance?\n\nAn exhibit says we buy stocks with the expectation they will appreciate. In other words, can I find a bigger sucker later? Yet if we don't participate in equities markets we lose to inflation. So why are the 10 percent return exhibit and the 1975 to now inflation exhibits on opposite corners of the museum?\n\nThe museum staff need to visit the Museum of Mathematics to learn how to make people think. Though you learn facts coming here you won't understand much more upon departure.\n\nOn the bright side its one of the least crowded attractions in NYC. The day we visited there was a longer line to get your picture taken next to the bull's rear end than to get into moaf. Unfortunately my visit here wasn't one of my better investments."},{"review":"I went there on a Thursday ( no, it was not a holiday ) with a pre-paid online discount, arrived there at 10:10 ( museum was supposed to be opened at 10 ).

I was disappointed that the guide said little about the building's construction except to say that it is a metal-framed building. The interior is extravagant and worth seeing. Tourees are however not especially welcome in the building and get a hasty exposure. With so much emphasis on Mr. Woolworth's venal character in the narrative, one can hardly be faulted for thinking: $30 for a 60 minute tour, much of which is spent outside in the park looking at the exterior? In Chicago, for example, the Chicago Architecture Foundation offers fine 60 minute building tours for $15.00. Of course, you'll say: It's New York! But still. The tour in my view is not worth the charge. (There are interiors as beautiful in Chicago, with glass mosaics and Tiffany domes, which are in buildings with free public access.) The irony is a bit thick here, especially in our day of egregious economic inequality: the tour is not shy about Mr. Woolworth's ego and his nickel-and-diming, and I left with the feeling that his spirit is alive and well in this building tour!"}]},{"nearBy":["St. Paul's Chapel","Century 21","City Hall Park Visitor Information Center"]}]},{"LuhringAugustineGallery.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"531 West 24th St","postalCode":"10011","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 206 9100"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"Das Erlebnis eines Ausstellungsbesuchs ist natürlich immer abhängig von der gezeigten Ausstellung.

Then my mom told me a story of how she went to New York not long after getting married (in the early 1950s), and taking a taxi through the Bowery, she remembered seeing bums and drunks throwing up on the streets. Not very attractive.\n\nBut the Bowery has come a long way. Yes, the lower end of it is still filled with the wholesale kitchen supply stores that keep the restaurant business in NYC running - not very exciting. But when you get to the heart of the street, where it meets Houston Street, it is humming. New luxury apartment buildings. Nice trendy bars and clubs. And my favorite place on the Bowery, the massive Whole Foods (where food shopping is filmed often on Top Chef and other food competition shows). Of course, what I love most about that Whole Foods is their incomparable beer store, with a selection nearly-unequaled by any other similar store in NYC."},{"review":"The Bowery is derived from the Dutch word for farm. It was once a rough part of town known for its poverty and homelessness. It has gone through gentrification but some of the older buildings are also preserved. The area can be visited by a number of bus tours and we toured the area on the HOHO bus tour."},{"review":"Ah, the Bowery in its \u201Cglory\u201D days! Seedy, scandalous, dirty, exciting place. To get a feeling of those times, see \u201CShe done him Wrong\u201D (1933) with Mae West and a very young Cary Grant. It\u2019s a street in lower Manhattan stretching from Chatham Square to Cooper Square. The name comes from the old Dutch word \u201Cbowerij\u201D meaning \u201Cfarm\u201D: the land was mostly owned by the Dutch Governor of New York, Peter Stuyvesant. As the City grew, the old Indian path expanded and became large street populated with oyster bars, taverns and minstrel show theaters. After the Civil War it gradually deteriorated and lost to Broadway its place as entertainment center. In the beginning of the Twentieth Century it was infamous: even the ladies of joy gravitated to other neighborhoods. Very little of those days is left, but the Mission from the movie is still there, still doing its mission. The Bowery Savings bank building is there in all its majestic glory, still doing its mission.\n The eyesore at 190 Bowery, at the corner of Bowery and Spring Street in New York City, was originally constructed to be the third home of Germania Bank in 1898. The building has changed hands a few times since then, and has been the home and studio of photographer Jay Maisel since 1966. If it looks like this from the outside (see photo), I\u2019d hate to find myself inside.\n The monumental building on the corner of Bowery & Canal Street is the former Citizens Saving Bank \u2014 portal to Manhattan, gateway to Chinatown and impregnable fortress of thrift. It now houses the Chinatown branch of HSBC.\n The area is of great historical interest to history\/NYC buffs, but few tourists would enjoy it, in my opinion. Recent attempts to gentrify it resulted in some modern cafes, but the place is still not enjoyable and I would recommend against visiting even if your Tourist Guide tells you to go\u2026Especially towards it end (where the Mission is)"}]},{"nearBy":["New Museum","The Bowery Ballroom","The Box"]}]},{"PoliceAcademyMuseum.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"235 East 20th St","postalCode":"10003-1801","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 477 9753"},{"reviews":[{"review":"ニューヨークシティパスでただで行けたので、近く通ったついでに行きました。\n狭くて、普通の会議室みたい。。。\n通ったらよってもいいけど、わざわざこれの為に行く必要はないかと思います。"}]},{"nearBy":["Gramercy Park","The National Arts Club","Outside In Walking Tours"]}]},{"SoHoManhattantoRemember3otherguides.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"South of Houston Street","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"SoHo is fun to walk in leisure and take advantage of the countless shops, boutiques, restaurants and cafes.

However, we took on board advice which suggested that visitors were regularly turned away and decided instead to try the Mother AME Zion Church. We didn't realise until we arrived that the two churches are across the road from each other on 137th street!\n\nThe first thing I should say is that this is a church service. If all you want to do is hear a Gospel performance then do just that and don't visit a church. You can probably budget for about 2 hours of your time - but on our visit the sermon itself was every bit as rewarding as the singing itself. The whole experience was tremendous. The only disappointment was the behaviour of some tourists, who took pictures when asked not to and who left before the end of the service. They should at least have had the decency to sit at the rear....\n\nYou will be welcomed, and the obvious upside for the church is the revenue taken from the visitors - suggested donation of $10. A small price to pay though. On our visit there were more visitors than parishioners although this may have had something to do with the regular choir being away and the service starting slightly earlier (normally starts at 11am).\n\nContrast our experience with that of the elderly German couple who we met at the bus stop on the way home. They'd stood in line for 3 hours, in baking heat, at the Abysinnian Church and still didn't get in....."},{"review":"Hamnade på denna kyrka då den vi skulle till var fylld.\n\nGanska folktom där de första var turister.

Since that time, the church has been the center of a religious feast in the street out front each July for the past 130 years. At one time was attended by upwards of 500,000 people. \n\nThe basilica's coronation came in 1904, during Pope St. Pius X's visit, in the wake of political controversies taking place within the American church, a pope's attempt to address some of the perceived injustices both within the church and out directed toward its latest in a long line of immigrants. There have been several documented miracles that have been performed by the Blessed Mother at this shrine. The image located there was proclaimed miraculous by His Holiness Pope Leo XIII, and crowned during the pontificate of Pope St. Pius X on July 10th, 1904\n\nToday, the church is under direction of was recently placed under the care of the Polish Pallottine order.

The New York Earth Room, a long-standing exhibit by Walter De Maria, was at the top of the list.\n\nAt its core, The New York Earth Room is literally an expansive 2nd floor Soho apartment filled with 3 feet of soil. My friend's face upon seeing the exhibit could be summed up with the acronym, \"W.T.F?\" I'm certain a lot of people would have a similar response, but I viewed it differently.\n\nSoho is a bustling area, full of trendy shops, cafes, and restaurants. The cobblestone streets are traffic laden, while the sidewalks are cluttered with locals shopping and tourists looking upwards snapping photos. The sound, smell and electricity is quintessential New York City.\n\nThe doorway to Walter De Maria's 2nd floor exhibit is a rabbit-hole of sorts. One moment, you're in the thick of the city. The next, your senses are enveloped, literally, by earth. The moisture in the air is of a recent spring rain. The scent is strongly earthy. Even the taste on your tongue is strangely 'umami.'\n\nIt's there in that moment you get the juxtaposition of your experience. Quietness, stillness and a pervasive sense of 'earth' secretly locked away in a concrete jungle of noise, chaos and never-ending movement. And to realize that this solitude has existed for 36 years only adds to the zen.\n\nThe Earth Room is definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.

There is a single walkway, lined with a few park benches, surrounding a centre fountain.

That\u2019s so interesting for me!\nIt's not about people dressing up!\nEven dog! Can you imagine?"},{"review":"We happened to be in New York on Easter and read about the parade. We ended up spending about 4 hours wondering around looking at the costumes and bonnets. It is definitely one of those you have to do once events. There was everything from the traditional to Star Wars and Ghost Busters outfits."},{"review":"We started on 5th ave and 53rd street (St. Thomas Cathedral), walking south. Had a blast looking at all the hats, outfits (from \"interesting\" to dapper) and just people watching. A \"must-do\" if in NYC on Easter, and a memory that last for the granddaughter!"},{"review":"Not what you expect of a parade, but still an interesting sight to behold. Hundreds of people in all sort of Easter garments with some of the most creative Easter Bonnets you could ever imagine."},{"review":"This has devolved from the formal stroll (seen in the eponymous Judy Garland movie) to more of a street fair. The top of the Easter Parade area, one block south of Central Park on 5th Avenue, had the lightest foot traffic and was safer for families. As you progress south on 5th Avenue, which is all closed off, it gets more crowded, and is the most congested right in front of the St. Patrick's Cathedral\/Rockefeller Center area. The best time to see lots of handmade and extravagant hats is around Noon, when everyone is on their way to or from brunch. Th street was closed around 10am this year, and the event merged with the afternoon activities at Rockefeller Center, where the skating rink was still open, and there was a large outdoor display of \"Faberge\" eggs decorated by local businesses and artists. There were a lot of food trucks along the route, and fewer than 10% of those dressed up were wearing full costumes or fully-coordinated outfits, but those who made the effort were the highlight of the event!"},{"review":"We didn't really know what to expect and arriving at 11am we were disappointed that there were very few people actually in hats, mostly tourists with cameras. However, by our second loop, or around noon the scene really picked up and was a lot of fun. Definitely worth a walk-through if you're in Manhattan on Easter."},{"review":"So much fun. If you are in NYC on Easter Sunday then you absolutely must make an effort the visit fifth avenue even if it's just for an hour."},{"review":"No spring visit to New York City is complete without a stroll along Fifth Avenue on Easter Sunday. Roughly from 1 to 3 p.m., the street is closed to traffic and thronged with tourists, gawkers, photographers and celebrants dressed in their Easter finery. Outrageous and original headgear is the order of the day, from feathers and plumage to carefully birdcages and doghouses, live birds and dogs included! The event is family friendly, photogenic and, best of all, 100% free."},{"review":"The Easter Parade is a delight for sightseers, not only for travellers but also for locals. \nOn Sunday the 5th avenue is only open to pedestrians, who walk along in hats...big, small, colorful, bizarre, weird hats which are worth photographing. I remember having seen an old lady wearing an enormous pink hat with garments. She was walking her dog, who was wearing the same hat in a smaller size!!...\nThe funniest thing about this unusual parade is that you can take pictures of the hats - asking for permission at the owners first, of course! - or even borrow one, put it on and smile to the camera..."},{"review":"We had such a good time at the 2013 Easter Parade. We were on a bus trip to NYC but brought our hats and joined in the fun. Cameras are definitely a must as some of the creations (hardly does them justice to simply call them hats!) are amazing. Don't expect floats or bands - it's not that type of parade. You are the parade along with thousands of others sporting their hats and Easter finery. It was one of the highlights of our trip!"}]},{"nearBy":["The Metropolitan Museum of Art","Delacorte Theater","Shakespeare Garden"]}]},{"NewYorkHarborNYCwiththefamily.2otherguides.html":[{"address":{"addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"reviews":[{"review":"The skyline view from the Brooklyn Bridge Park is beautiful!

The food is good, though not amazing. The ambiance more than makes up for it - been coming here for years and witnessed five marriage proposals!!!"},{"review":"This place is a relic. I'm sure it was very enjoyable in its heyday, but it all feels very cold and dated. It feels more like a catering hall for a wedding (mostly devoid of charm) than it does a place for fine dining. I'm sure seasonally it's much better. By this I mean: it's probably better in the summer and probably for lunch. There is a lovely view of the water and the city, but nothing you can't experience by simply sitting on a bench. The food was fine, but the menu was uncreative and field dated. Basically not interesting or delicious enough for the price. If you go anytime other than summer make sure you dress warmly as the coldness of the dining room mixed with the multitude of windows will make you freeze. The service was good. I just expected so much more of a place with such prestige and history. It needs a major makeover. You would be better served somewhere with less of a \"name\". If you need to be in Central Park or need views of it, try the restaurants in the Time Warner building. Much better food, much better atmosphere."},{"review":"Central Park is an incredible place and for $15 for an hour of rowing I can't complain!

At the dining areas for example with Comicon 2015, there were not enough chairs and tables for that many guests even if they came during different times of the day.\n2. There were no electrical wall outlet to charge your mobile device. Make sure to carry portable charging devices with you especially if you plan on being here for the whole day.\n3. Bathroom, not enough of them and they were all located very far from the main exhibitors areas.\n\nWhile these \"CONS\" may not seem like a lot, they are life saving for exhibitors who spends more than 10 hours standing all day all week long, and not a place to sit down for even a minute to relax their legs. The Moscone Center in San Francisco, the Los Angeles Convention Center, and what even surprised me the most was the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida where when you came out of the exhibition rooms, there were sofas everywhere including a charging wall outlet below the sofas!! \n\nI would hope that the people in charge of running the \"Experience\" both for the Exhibitors and Attendees would look at my review as a constructive review and hope that they can provide a better experience for everybody, considering this is New York City and this is after all, the Jacobs Javits Convention Center.\n\nUntil then, Cheers! ~ :p"},{"review":"We went to the Javits center for ComiCon this year.

Great costume venue...so many cosplay people. People watching is awesome.

Too many people at times...don't go if you suffer from anxiety in crowds. People of all ages.

We purchased the New York Super Week Cards for extra $10 each per person thinking they would get us something special\/extra at the show. Don't waste your money on those cards, there aren't enough vendors to make use of getting your money's worth. Save that $10 to buy something else. We were there one day only Thursday's event.

They end up with a hit Off-Broadway musical! I had been anticipating this show for two years ever since I heard about plans to bring it to New York's theater district. My wife and I and two friends made a special trip to NYC just to see this show. I had high expectations after fabulous reviews by New York critics (although I always reserve a note of skepticism when it comes to critics and decide for myself), BUT, I had my socks knocked off. Expectations were exceeded by six extremely talented, strongly intelligent women who wowed the audience to receive standing ovations. \n\nThese ladies of the tiaras didn't just lampoon fairytale princesses...they were sassy and independent, which I find to be a very attractive feature in women, and took a delicious and feminist stand against the princess pablum we were fed as kids, all within the 500-seat fortress of the Theater at St. Clement's on 46th Street, Manhattan. What I found most wonderful about the performances, were not just the great voices and strong characters portrayed exactly as we would imagine. It's been said by many schools of acting that acting is 10% acting and 90% reacting. Well, these gals exceeded even that. Every seat in the house is close enough to see their facial expressions which alone were pictures worth a thousand words each and barrels of laugh out loud humor. The nuances and inflections in their dialogue and songs were priceless, like adding diamonds to tiaras. \n\nThe show is wonderfully subversive to Disney's laundered spin that creates a romantic world that doesn't exist; sets little girls up for unrealistic expectations; and men who think that all little girls grow up wanting nothing more than to be a princess in a fairytale waiting for their \"prince\" to rescue them from...well, whatever. That may sound cynical and unfair according to our memories of the Brothers Grimm, but this show succeeds because it is so different and so honest in a way that no one has dared to express previously. I'm betting that even Walt Disney would have been entertained. The fact that Disenchanted was a big hit while playing in Disney World's backyard of Orlando gives credence to this being a must see. The music is terrific, all six voices are powerful, with many stage credits to their names and you just might fall in love with these gals (Michelle Knight, Becky Gulsvig, Jen Bechter, Alison Burns, Lulu Picart, Soara-Joye Ross, Erin Leih Peck, Anthea Neri, and Karen Burthwright) who tell it like it is. I've seen hundreds of professional shows (been in a few professional plays and musicals myself) which prefaces saying this: Disenchanted is a show I would love to see again and again, not only because of great music woven with a clever, hysterically funny, and brilliant way of popping the happily-ever-after bubble. These princesses are anything but ditzy and dutiful (well they do have moments where they intentionally play ditzy as a badge of parody or very funny sarcasm). The show is not for children and although the language is adult, it's really for grown up kids like me who love to question everything in life. \n\nKudos to writer and composer Dennis T. Giacino, veteran producers Don Frantz and Jonathan Pollard, and director Dennis Giacino. You better hurry because the limited 9-week run ends this month. Reserve tickets for five friends and get 10% off, plus your ticket is free (ask for the \"Fairy Godmother Offer\").

The exhibition was a lot larger than I expected and I was in there a couple of hours. To get the most value for your money, as it isn't the cheapest attraction, is to ensure you read and have a go at everything. \n\nThe only thing I didn't like was the constant attempt to squeeze more money out of you, between the photos and the video, it was a bit much."},{"review":"If you are a true Hunger Games fan, the DTS exhibit is definitely not something to miss.

So benannt nach Andrew Carnegie, der sein Haus an der 5th Ave. und 91.St. hatte, das heutzutage das Cooper Hewitt Design Museum ist. Bei meinem letzten Besuch in New York im Februar 2011 habe ich einmal einen Spaziergang (in mehreren Etappen) zu den Kirchen rund um diesen Carnegie Hill gemacht. Die berühmtesten New Yorker Gotteshäuser sind wohl St. Patricks in Midtown und St. John the Devine an der 112. Str., aber hier am Carnegie Hill gibt es auch sehr schöne Gotteshäuser der verschiedenen Konfessionen. \nDie St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral liegt auf 15 E 97th Str. (so richtig schön mit Zwiebeltürmen versehen) \u2013 etwas weiter südlich an der Ecke 93th Str. und Park Avenue befindet sich ein Backsteinbau mit einem schönen schmiedeeisernen Tor zum Innenhof hin: Es ist die Synode of the Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church outside Russia. \nDrei Strassen höher steht eine Hallenkirche mit der Fassade zur 96th Str.135 East die katholische St. Francis de Sales Kirche, ein grau-weisser Bau, innen aber schön renoviert (bunt und glänzend). Zurück zur Park Avenue, und die hinunter gebummelt, da kommt man an verschiedenen Kirchen vorbei \u2013 immer auf der westlichen Park Ave. Seite. \nBesucht habe ich die Kirche des Hl. Ignatius von Loyola auf Park Avenue und 84th Str. Eine grosse katholische Kirche, die zu den Gottesdiensten \u2013 als ich dort war - sehr gut besucht war. Auch einen Besuch wert, wenn man nicht speziell zu den Gottesdiensten kommt. Interessant bei dieser Kirche ist, dass sich unter dem Hauptschiff die so genannte Wallace Hall befindet, in der auch Familiengottesdienste abgehalten werden. \nAuf der belebten 86th Str. \/Nähe Park Ave. befindet sich die Methodist Episcopal Church. Zwei Strassen südlich \u2013 auf der 84th Str. 339 East kann man die Deutsche Evangelische Kirche von Yorkville sehen (ob hier noch Feiern stattfinden ist mir nicht bekannt.) \nUnd wieder etwas nördlich auf der 87th Str. 404 East liegt die Katholische St. Joseph\u2019s Kirche.

This was the seat of the newborn American government before the capitol of the nascent nation was moved to Philadelphia and then Washington. It is not the original building but there are numerous representations of the first structure to be in that location. The current Federal Hall dates from the 1840s and there is also a larger-than-life statue of George Washington standing outside. Of course the main claim to fame here is that this is where GW took the oath of office as the first president, and how many Americans can even conceive of the effort it took to create a new form of government and a new country out of a clear blue sky? The artifacts and the paintings of that momentous occasion really enable the viewer to go back in time and join in the inauguration festivities as well as get a real taste of post-colonial New York, which had just endured eight years of occupation by the British Army.

We got a good deal with discounted tickets from Broadwaybox. The stage design, although minimalist does convey the feeling of a trip around the world, and the proximity to the stage makes you feel a part of the voyage."},{"review":"I've been to very few off-Broadway shows and after seeing Around the World in 80 Days, I realized what I've been missing. This was better than a number of the Broadway shows I've seen. In a time when just about everything seems to be a musical, it is nice to see a regular play.\n\nThis show is appropriate for children. It is a little long and may be a bit too slow for younger children. For adults, it's a very entertaining evening out at a fraction of the cost of a Broadway show. \n\nThe stage is very small, but with clever design, it adds too rather than detracts from the show. I thought the set design was brilliant and it is rare in a show where some of the best laughs come not from the lines, but from the set and props themselves. It's worth seeing this show for the set alone.\n\nOn the night we saw the show, Dorien Makhloghi, the understudy, played the role of Phileas Fogg. I couldn't help but wonder why he is an understudy. He didn't deliver his lines perfectly, but this guy has incredible charisma. With slapstick and silliness all around him, he made Phileas elegant and refined. He has enormous potential. \n\nMuch of the rest of the acting is over-the-top and very enjoyably so. Unfortunately, the chemistry between Aouda and Phileas was really lacking for me. \n\nThe director\/set designer, and producer, Cedric Yau, should be very proud for creating such a fun show in this theater. It's a small and grungy theater (particularly the restrooms), but the design and costumes transform it to another time and place."},{"review":"We got very discounted tickets to this play and had heard nothing about it beforehand. I cannot say it was great (like Kinky Boots), but I can say that I was entertained and completely appreciated the hard-working, energetic actors. The scenery was imaginative and attractive, as were the costumes. The theatre is tiny, so it doesn't matter where you sit, you will have a good view anywhere."},{"review":"Being honest, we hadn't planned to attend this one - it was one of those last minute affairs when we intended to attend a musical....\n\nWe bought the tickets and the booth assistant said 'round the back' and off we trotted and several streets and blocks and imagining we were walking out of New York.... two policemen later, finally we found it though neither of them knew where the 'New Theater' was. OK I exaggerate a little and the address was on the tickets\n\nHowever, it's a quaint theatre and exceptionally well prepared for the fast-moving, performance done in exceptional style and accuracy by the cast of five - well done indeed!\n\nHow they remember so many quick-fire lines, let alone the costume changes - the energy is amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.\n\nThe intimacy of the theatre means you're sitting there with the performers too - no need for opera glasses there!\n\nThere might not be much in the way of refreshments available but the theatre reminded me of the calibre of talent 'out there' and either those making their way, or hoping to do so, or just hiding for a break in a more illustrious career, can be found here and all power to their elbows for their individual futures. Certainly we expect to see them in higher planes in the future, even if a return trip to NY is pretty unlikely for us.\n\nEach of them 'has what it takes' and very professionally discharged. So yes, I commend the performance to you - help fill the vacant seats and make a path, rather than worry about where others' paths have been! definitely worth finding the theatre and enjoying yourselves with the performance!"},{"review":"Being a \"local\" we've been to a lot of shows; Broadway, off-Broadway and even off-off-Broadway (yes that is a real thing). \n\nSo happy we got to see this show. We got discount tickets to see this play and figured we had nothing to lose for the cost. If choosing to see this play, you have to remember this is off-Broadway, so the venue will not be as grand, nor will the effects be like a Disney production. If you are looking for a REAL New York City play experience though, and not a tourist attraction (for example Lion King) this is the one to see. The story line is good for kids, no nudity or bad words, although it might be hard to children under 9 to follow the plot. The stage, although small, is elaborately and creatively done in a steam-punk fashion with some great lighting effects and a circular screen image which all really ad to the show. Great period costuming as well. The cast is small, but the talent huge. Some play multiple roles and all are fantastic. Lots of subtle humor, not slapstick but definitely funny stuff! Don't want to ruin the show, but the train scenes and an elephant scene were very funny. The cast does a great job of acting out being on a train.\n\nTip- do not sit in the first few rows. The seats more toward the back are better, as there is a lot going on up high. There is a very small bar that sells very basic refreshments, no alcohol. (If you want to be a real NY'er you can BYOB in your purse) The show runs about 2 hours including a 15 minute intermission. The ladies room is tiny and had a line so if you must, go before or after. Enjoy the elevator if you want, it's an old freight-style. We walked around upstairs a bit just to enjoy the building itself. \n\nSo bottom line, know what to expect and don't be shocked at the lack of grandeur. Enjoy the creative set, the amazing talent, let your imagination go with it and have an authentic NYC play experience on the cheap. You won't be disappointed."},{"review":"Family went to this off Broadway production upon the suggestion of a stranger on the street so I did not know what to expect. From the outside & lobby, I was a bit concerned as it did not look like much. However, the inside was very creative. The entire theatre is painted like an 19th century warehouse. The stage was multi-leveled & appeared to have many bells & whistles which the show proved true. Only 5 actors participate in the revision of the Jules Vern classic. The costumes were first rate as was the way that the costume changes were performed as part of the show. The actors & actress appeared to be having a hoot performing the witty script. The acting was excellent. The actors have perfected the stereotype of people from around the world. My boys 8 & 11 loved the performance. My wife & I felt the same.

It is much more easily examined from another observation point like a tall building with an unobstructed view, or a public observation spot like the Empire State Building or Top of the Rock. There is no observation tower in the Chrysler Building. There is nothing in the building that caters to anyone who wants to view the inside or outside of this magnificent treasure. The lobby is rather small...there are a few frescos or murals on the walks. But this is a no-nonsense office building with high security. You cannot enter the building beyond the small public foyer unless you work in the building, have a pass to prove it. Or, if you are on your way to ne of the offices where your name must be on a list, you have photo ID and have a photo badge issued for access. Sadly, many tourists don't know this and are disappointed.

So when I got a great tip about this wonderful Cottage that was re-assembled in the Park to provide entertainment, I walked as fast as I could. Its critical audience is of course children, but adults, you must go. The work that goes into staging, story writing and puppet making is painstakingly incredible. Being away from electronics for a break was energizing. The gardens and the path will revive your spirit just as the laughter from the show . Go out after and grab a snack from a food vendor!"},{"review":"You can find the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theatre Just off 79th Street, near the Belvedere Castle. This 19th century cottage house was built in Sweden in 1875, shown in the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition the following year before being bought and moved to NYC's Central Park in 1877. \n\nThe cottage is one of many interesting things to discover in Central Park. During its time here, it has served a variety of functions. However, since 1947, it has hosted marionette theatre performances, providing another family friendly form of leisure and entertainment. You can see the marionette performance schedule online at the cityparksfoundation website if interested. \n\nEven if you are not particularly interested in the performances, the cottage is still interesting to see if you end up spending time in this area of the park.. The cottage is a example of Swedish 19th century architecture and is of very nice craftsmanship. If you've not seen building types like this before, its well worth a quick look-see before making your way to other attractions in Central Park."},{"review":"A family member gave us the idea of coming here during a recent 2-day stay in the city.

The staff was also quite accommodating and pleasant and the facilities (including restrooms) clean and cheery. I HIGHLY recommend!!"},{"review":"We took our daughter to see the holiday show and to make a puppet. She loved making the puppet. And while I found the show to be uneven, my daughter and the other children enjoyed themselves.

We didn't buy tickets in advance, and they were basically full with 2 school groups attending, but having showed up when the doors opened (about 20 min before showtime), they were very nice to let the 4 of us attend the show. It's very affordable for NYC standards. The kids loved the show, however we adults though it wasn't the greatest. The puppetry was phenomenal (at least to us, who had never seen a marionette show) but the story was bleh. Still very much worth a visit if you have young children (ours are 6 and 8). As others have stated, it's close to the castle which is nice for the kids to play on\/around before\/after the show and only about 2 blocks from the Museum. Show was only about an hour long."},{"review":"We happened upon the Swedish cottage while walking through Central Park just as the show was starting.

It is a quiet place and I felt very much at home in it."},{"review":"After receiving a calendar of Roerich this was high on the list of places to see in NYC. It was not disappointing at all with many of the artists best paintings from the Himalayas. The flute concert upstairs was a added bonus. Admission is free but prints and other objects are for sale."},{"review":"This small museum is a true hidden treasure in New York, it houses the work of Nicholas Roerich an excellent painter from the Russian Symbolist period who was also a great scene designer, as a matter of fact the museum has the designs for the sets of the controversial \"Rite of Spring\" ballet produced by the Diaghilev company in Paris to Nijinsky's choreography which caused quite a scandal at the opening in Paris May 29, 1913. \nThe museum is in an old-style town house, which is in itself a rarity worth seeing as most of these houses have been torn down to make way for high-rises and many of the ones that are still extant have 'state of the art' interiors that have nothing to do with the original structure. \nThe collection of paintings gives you a good idea of the painter's style, there are many Buddhist art works that Roerich bought as souvenirs from his travels to Tibet, beautifully displayed as well as some very good paintings by the artist's son who was also an accomplished painter. The whole atmosphere brings to life the Symbolist style. The small book store by the reception desk has a very nice selection of post cards and books and the museum also holds an ongoing series of concerts and lectures that make it worth going back for another visit."},{"review":"Tucked in a townhouse on the upper west side (W 107 St) is the Nicholas Roerich Museum. His motto was \"Where there is Culture, there is Peace,\" which predates UNESCO's cultural preservation by decades. He devised a three ball image to symbolize Art, Science and Religion.\n Additionally, he was an explorer and painter. His palette is interesting- mainly blues, but somehow holding the light of the high peaks of the Himalayas or other areas he visited. Much of his art is in the townhouse, but not all. Those are captured on postcards for sale in the small gift shop. Stairs but no elevator.\n Oh- surprise: entry is free!"},{"review":"I discovered the works of Nicholas Roerich many years ago when ready some of the Theosophical books and immediately wanted to view the originals as I knew, from the description of his unique techniques, that no reproduction could ever capture the luminosity he imbued his work with. I did my research and found out about the museum in New York and made a special trip to see it. My experience was beyond my expectation both in the artistic value of the paintings and in the subject they represent.\n\nOver the years I have personally taken friends to the museum and recommended it to many more. With a wide circle of friends in New York I continue to be amazed that hardly any of then knew they had such a treasure so near by. \n\nThe museum would be easily missed if you weren't looking for it specifically as it is in a three story brownstone on the upper west side identified only by the brass placque with \"Nicholas Roerich Museum\" and the building number \"319.\" \n\nAs with so many friends I most highly recommend you take the time to search this out and spend a day enjoying the life's work of this great man - a Life of Luminous Color and Light."},{"review":"There is no shortage of art on display in New York City, but the venues displaying said art can be daunting.

The entrance is hard to find on both sides and it is very noisy to walk across with traffic right next to you and very busy. There is a good police presence and security cameras which makes you feel secure. It is worth a walk across at least once in the day and definitely at night but that's it. After that I would take the express shuttles that are offered to go across. They are fast and cheap at $2 per person each way. There are signs that say the bridge closes at midnight....I assume they mean to walk across but I am not sure of that fact. It is much cheaper to stay at a hotel in Fort Lee and take the bridge across to NYC. On the NY side there are signs pointing in the direction of the subway line.

With very much surprise I was told by the lady in the front \"If you go to a mosque you follow their rules and here our business is to make our rules to be followed\"... I answered \"I´ve visited some mosques our the world and they provides you with the proper attire if you don't have that\"... \"is not part of our business\" was her answer.\nAt this point in time I was really sad and one of my girls (11 year old) says \"clothing is not what gives meaning to man ... is the man who gives meaning to man ... Don´t cry mom, I´m sad for you, because you want us to be here... but we can go to any other chuch\" What a clever girl! We went to another one and even it drives me to tears again writing this revision, I think you must reconsider your policies... we were not there to sue the church, because a possible fall as you said, but to share the worship to our common God, who probably dress up a tunic and you will not let Him get in.\nYour \"business\" must be the gospel not your rules.\nGod bless you and make you savvy on His real things."},{"review":"I can't recommend a trip here enough. It does involve arriving around an hour before the service, and then committing to a 2 hour mass, so not just a casual trip. You also have to wear smart, modest clothes as a mark of respect to the regular parishioners, but these are small inconveniences for such a unique experience. I am a Christian so was very keen to experience a gospel church, but I went with 2 atheists who were much less enthusiastic. However, both were completely in awe of the amazing choir, and even more impressed by the preacher's inspirational and impassioned sermon. My mum, who isn't religious at all, was moved to tears by the sense of optimism and community spirit expressed by the preacher and by the service as a whole. While welcoming to visitors, the service allows visitors to observe the amazing community bonds between the congregation, as they celebrate members and their recent achievements. Some visitors were very disrespectful towards the welcome extended by the church, and chatted loudly throughout the service. Therefore, although a visit is highly recommended, I would urge any potential visitors to be respectful and polite if they do make the trip to the church. The choir's energy and enthusiasm had us all singing and dancing along, and hearing gospel music in person is very special. The whole experience provided very special memories, and I'm sure would be enjoyed by those of faith or not. My atheist friend, who has visited New York 6 times previously, said visiting the Abyssinian Church was the best thing she has ever done in the city."},{"review":"Cannot believe tourists with negative comments. Many tourists come with no respect for regular churchgoers who come with passion for the Lord. Tourists come in shorts, talk during service and show little interest in the service. We were welcomed into the congregation, loved the passion of the sermon and the two hours passed like no other church service ever before. I would certainly join regular service if all like this. Don,t miss this if you are prepared to act in a decent manner in a church."},{"review":"I am a Christian.\n\nDuring my stay in NYC I decided, with my family, to go to this Church for the Sunday Mass.\nWe wanted both to meet the Abyssinian Community and to listen to their (supposed) wonderful voices.\n\nWE WERE SIMPLY NOT LET INSIDE.\n\nOur sin was to be tourists and to not be part of that Community.\nNow I say: who can decide wether another human being can or cannot enter a Church?\nI would like to remind to my Abyssinian brothers that every Church is first the house of God.\nNone can disagree on this point, otherwise he is not a Christian.\nAs a consequence, none can decide who is worth entering. For no reason.\n\nA comparison: you go to the White House and the doorman does not let you inside. But the president has invited you and is willing to share time with you.\nAn overall contradiction.\n\nI hope someone will take into consideration my simple and short reasoning.\n\nThank you!\n\nP.S.: You all were so elegant. I dare say too elegant.\nRead about S. Francis and learn from him.\nHe might help you."},{"review":"First thing to remember is that this is a church which exists to offer a place of worship for the congregation. Don't go if you are just after \"a show\". The Sunday I attended, out of perhaps 100-150 tourists, only a handful actually participated in the service (singing, praying etc.).\n\nService took 2hrs, we arrived to the queue 40min before and were quite in the front. Probably due to the freezing weather. \n\nThey are strict with their rules, but I didn't find that overly controlling. Check out the dress code and rules about back bags (i.e not allowed) and you'll be fine. \n\nThe services was beautiful and inspiring. Choir A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Pastor very passionate.\nNo fee to enter, however (as in any church) an offering is customary."},{"review":"I arrived with several hundred other visitors in search of inspiration and that's what this church provides: an excellent choir and band, beautiful building, warm welcome and inspirational service. It's an insight into the dedication of people in Harlem to help one another and build a real sense of community.\nHowever... the church advertises its presence to tourists and receives many more visitors than it can house. My suggestion is to arrive early (before 10am), collect a free ticket from the main door and then go for coffee somewhere before joining the queue sometime before 11am. All the comments made by others about regimental crowd control are accurate. There seems however no need at all for any of this. Why not just allow visitors to enter the church when they arrive, go upstairs and wait out of the rain? Or the heat? When the upstairs is full, there could be a standby queue for empty places downstairs and then maybe a bus to take visitors to another church in the area. All this rubbish about sandals, water bottles and backpacks is totally unnecessary. Didn't Christ himself wear sandals, drink water and carry most of his possessions on his back?\nThere are plenty of other gospel churches in the neighbourhood - but it's just a question of finding them.\nIf you do get in - and out two hours later - I recommend Monna's Soulfood diner on Lennox Avenue for a tasty and cheap lunch. \nJust the ticket."},{"review":"I was attending a service with a friend on a very warm sunday in June. We arrived about 1,5 hours before service was supposed to start. There were about 20 people in front of us but in half an hour the line reached the next street corner. Members of the church were marching around and giving orders. People were supposed to stand in line in pairs. Each time somebody broke this rule by taking a step into wrong direction he was told to step back in line or else he would lose his place. Some people were pulled back from the line and told they were wearing inappropriate clothing. They were allowed to hire extra clothing from some people having a small business by the sidewalk. The service started half and hour late which meant that we stood there in line for two hours. Finally we got in and were made to sit in front of the A\/C. A nice elderly couple from Spain sat on the wrong bench (due to a misunderstanding) and a church member started yelling at them and telling them to leave. Confused, the spanish gentleman tried to explain but the man kept shouting \"you had your chance! you had your chance!\". Day was very warm and the air conditioning at full blast. After fifteen minutes we were shivering with cold. After about and hour people tried to leave but weren't allowed. Members of the church stood menacingly on the way and made people go back to their seats. After half an hour more some people had enough and made a break for it. Me and my friend stayed until the bitter end about 2,5 hours later. \n\nService was actually nice and the choir wonderful. I just don't think that treating people like cattle belongs to any church. Nobody was actually dressed inappropriately or misbehaving. It almost felt like the people from the church enjoyed their powers and wanted to boss around. I'm sad we wasted a sunny day in a place like this. Would not recommend it to anybody."},{"review":"To start off, I would like to say that I am a college student, born and raised in a traditional Southern Baptist home. With the traditional southern values instilled in my upbringing, I know how to act in church as well as what is acceptable to wear. This past weekend (Memorial Day 2014), I visited the Abyssinian Baptist Church and was initially turned away because of my attire. Prior to our visit, my group researched their website in order to view the policy on tourist dress code (which can be found at http:\/\/abyssinian.org\/contact-us\/visitors\/) so that we would not be turned away as we previously heard. However, as soon as I exited the cab in front of the church, a woman, who I assumed was a member, verbally abused me saying that I could not enter the church because my dress was \"too short,\" further yelling that they aren't \"running a club\" and didn't want people like me there. First of all, the dress I was wearing passes the traditional \"fingertip\" rule used by numerous lower level schools and church camps. Years ago, I wore this exact dress to church camps as well as high school without difficulty. For those of you who don't know of the \"fingertip\" rule, the apprehended dresser my lower their arms to their side and if their fingertips fall below the hem of the bottoms, it is considered too short, if your fingertips meet above the hem, it is considered acceptable. I am 5'6'' with a wingspan of 5'9'' meaning that it is very difficult for me to even find attire that meets the \"fingertip\" rule, so when this woman chastised me for my dress I was extremely offended. Second, I followed every rule listed on the website I provided, my shoulders were covered, no shorts, leggings, flip flops, or tank tops on display here. Just a dress with a cardigan and I was still turned away. How is it acceptable to even turn away people who are actively seeking to worship. It is extremely disheartening that a church turns away from people who aren't dressed appropriately, as Christians we are called to \"love everyone as God loves us\" and to not \"judge or you too will be judged.\" Finally, in reference to the \"club\" comment from the woman, I have never set foot in a club, I have never drank or smoked, and I have been committed to the \"True Love Waits\" program, so as you can see, when she accused me of being the \"club\" type, I was extremely offended. After being reprimanded by this woman, I spoke to another woman on the side walk seeking admittance into the church. She said that what I was wearing was acceptable and proceeded to ask, who I assume was, a deacon if what I was wearing was appropriate and he said yes, I told him of my experience with the rude woman and he said to forget about it and that he would get us into the church. After asking where we were from (Arkansas) he told us to go wait across the street for the service to begin. I have never been more humiliated or under such accusation from someone in my entire life. Such a bitter experience completely ruined my attitude towards this church during the service, meaning that I cannot rate the service due to my appalled rage from the experiences outside. So to be forewarned of being a visitor to this \"church\" the people on the outside will judge you, based on your \"outward appearance.\""},{"review":"Shameful.\n\nAs ordained ministers in another denomination, we sought out this \"Church\" for worship last Sunday morning (1 Nov 2015) as it was mentioned in the guide books for this, our first visit to New York. However, I suspected something was not right when, instead of the usual \"welcome\" signs outside, there was a board outside demanding NO shorts, NO sandals, NO phones, NO cameras, NO drinks and so on... a whole list of them. Where was the \"welcome\"? Nowhere. We walked to the door expecting to be greeted with the usual smile and welcome, or even a handshake and a 'where are you from' as we would do to visitors at our own churches here in the UK. But no. We were greeted with a hard, rude, rather objectionable bouncer-woman at the door who told us we were not welcome. When pressed, it was, apparenty, because my wife was carrying a small bag. She offered to have it searched if there was a concern over security, but the bouncer was having none of it, and screamed at us, shouting that, in no uncertain terms, we were to go away. And to go away there and then.\n\nOthers were trying to get in too, but were told they were 'inappropriately dressed' (no tie?) or 'not one of us' and also snubbed and told to clear off.\n\nI can understand if there are some who simply come to gawp at the spectacle of so-called \"gospel choirs\" but we simply wanted to attend worship as Christians from across the pond in the UK, as we always do wherever we end up on vacation, and enjoy experiencing the rich diversity of the Christian Church across the world. But here we felt hurt, abused and snubbed because, for the first time in our 61 years on this planet, we had been turned away from a (presumably) House of God. And by those who professed to be fellow-Christians too. One wonders how many people Jesus turned away because they were inappropriately dressed or were not \"respectable\" enough. \n\nMy fears were confirmed about the priorities of this so-called \"Church\" when we saw the minister's car - a top-of-the-range brand new BMW limousine in its own private parking space, showing just how much of a \"humble servant\" he seems to be.\n\nI cannot comment on the worship in this church as we were told in no uncertain terms that we were not wanted there. But I suspect that those who commented favourably here have a limited experience of what a Church is meant to be. Just because a choir sings beautifully about God, or a person stands in a pulpit spouting out empty hypocritical words, this does not make it honouring to God. The first priority of a Christian is to show love - a love for God, and, as a response t that love, to show an unconditional love to all people whether or not they carry a bag, or wear sandals, or have a phone - or whether or not they fit into the narrow bigoted band of \"respectability\" that these so-called Christians demanded. \n\nThe words of St Paul come to mind when HE chastised the Church in Corinth for a very similar attitude: \" [1 Cor 13 1-2] I may be able to speak (and sing!) the languages of human beings and even of angels, but if I have no love, my speech is no more than a noisy gong or a clanging bell. I may have the gift of inspired preaching; I may have all knowledge and understand all secrets; I may have all the faith needed to move mountains\u2014but if I have no love, I am nothing. \"\n\nI cannot think of more apt words for this so-called Church in Harlem. \n\nThey need to realise that Christ welcomed the outcasts of society, not the \"respectable\" whom they considered fitted in with their preconceived snobbish clique. And all this from an ethnic group who themselves were snubed just a generation or two ago. Have they short memories? Do they forget how THEY felt? AsChristians should they not be above this sort of thing?\n\nThere is a happy ending, though. When we left the Church, a lovely lady, also on her way to another church, heard our conversation, and, as an answer to prayer, offered to take us to her own church - St Thomas's - just five minutes walk away. What a difference. The worship was Godly, loving, VERY joyful and inclusive, and visitors - of all nationalities - were made to feel very welcome and wanted. After coffee after the service we felt that we had really met some new brothers and sisters in Christ, and have now agreed to keep in touch.\n\nMay God bless them richly."}]},{"nearBy":["Apollo Theater","Harlem","Hamilton Grange National Memorial"]}]},{"CentralParkZooNYCwiththefamily.2otherguides.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"830 Fifth Avenue","postalCode":"10021","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" +1 212-439-6500"},{"reviews":[{"review":"Our 8 year old son liked this place a lot.

The commentary on the audio about what the artists were up to in each picture made sure I got more out of the visit. \n\nI also had an \"Oh my God\" moment when the audio mentioned that two Veronese paintings had once been owned by in the 1600s by Queen Christina of Sweden -- very strange to be in the same room with something that belonged to a famous royal hundreds of years ago.\n\nI have two new favorite paintings from this visit. The Wool Winder by Jean-Baptiste Greuze (had never heard of him before) and Winter by Francois Boucher. \n\nThe museum is stuffy and a little hard on the feet.

(Hint: The butlers stole the show!)\nThe theater itself was fine...a bit worn, but nice. We originally had very inexpensive seats in the balcony, but since it was during the previews, seats in the orchestra opened up, so we got great seats in the orchestra essentially for free! Seats even in the orchestra rear were just fine, and you could hear and see quite well. Be advised that if you do sit in the balcony, do NOT sit in the first 2 rows...your view is obstructed by the balcony rail."},{"review":"Fabulous comedic show. Renee Fleming is fabulous, and so is the entire cast. A million laughs. The seats definitely have more legroom and the side seats are great for this show with full visibility.

Allegiance is a love story, a story about family strain under incredible stress, and a history lesson about the WWII experiences of Japanese Americans. Make sense for a musical? Well they make it work. Remember how great Miss Saigon was - though set in the Vietnam War? The show plays a bit like a retro musical with a fresh new story and music. Highly recommended.

That said, I cannot in good conscience say \"don't go\" to this theater. The show, My Son the Waiter was one of the best I have had the pleasure of seeing while living here in New York. It took me from laughter to tears and back again in the course of an hour and a half. I will recommend it to anyone and everyone. \nThe theater is tucked into a small space above a Turkish restaurant. I passed by it twice before discovering it's wherabouts. They don't open the box office until a half hour before the show starts and I am not sure how they decide who sits where, but my cousin and I had the good fortune of sitting at the bar directly facing the stage (basically the cheaper seats, but I thought the better ones as we could sit looking straight ahead whereas those down on the floor had to look sideways). There is that dumb two drink rule and they automatically tag an 18% gratuity onto your bill, but I like having a drink with my show anyway, so it was not that bad for NYC. The drinks weren't watered down as some can be, so I felt like it was just part of the night's expenses. I don't expect to save money in NYC, so just plan on having two drinks, ranging from $6-$14 and sit back and enjoy the show."},{"review":"After spending $40.00 for two tickets, we were then charged a two drink minimum. Drink pricing ranged from $6.00 soft drinks to $12.00 martinis and $9.00 glasses of wine. Given that I was the designated driver, I opted for the wine and soft drink for my two choices. 18% tip is graciously included. If you want a snack $4.00 will get you a small bag of flat pretzel chips!\n\nI understand that these NYC prices, and we only put up with it because a family member was in the cast, Other than that, I would take a pass. The one saving grace was that I was able to find street parking close to the theater."},{"review":"Just saw the one man show, My Son the Waiter, which was funny and enjoyable.\nUnfortunately, the theatre was less so.

It is an intimate venue with table seating. We went with the VIP seats and were seated at a table for two right by the stage. We couldn't ask for better seats.

What we love about the GE building is the elaborate crown, which elaborately tops the building tower. \n\nThe crown decor is intriguing and very interesting to see. Here you will find an elegant blend of gothic and art deco architectural style in a design representing electric waves. In our mind, it just screams 'Gotham' and the NYC that we think about from old films. \n\nNote that you'll need to look up to the very top of the building which is 50 stories so its easy to miss the crown if you don't know what you are looking for. Viewing from directly in front of the General Electric building is no good as well as you are too close and won't have a decent viewing position. \n\nTo properly see the crown, start having a look from a couple hundred meters away as you approach the building. If you have a camera with a long lens this can be very helpful and allow some great pictures, if sky conditions are favourable. Pictures of the top of the General Electric Building with a blue sky background are really neat to see."},{"review":"Great place especially if you like SNL, Seinfeld, Friends, etc..

One of them is indeed on 6th Av between 49th and 50th and really seems to be part of the Rockefeller Centre and in my opinion is the less interesting of the 2.

They pushed me away and forced to rip my tix apart when I had a tix that's expired by a day this past winter. I was denied boarding the boat in front of a large crowd and embarrassed by the crew as I was obviously pleading for them to honor me a break but I wasn't getting any where, yes that' s all in front of everyone. think I am a woman they would give me a break, NO, No Way!! not only that, I had to wait for 30 min for the next boat to come. That's last year's winter when it's bitter cold if you remember in the east coast. \n\nThey encourage people to buy the 10 tix packages to save a little, not a bad thing but once when a tix is expired, you loose 100% values of the tix. is this even legal that they can do this to customers? has anyone checked? I will look into that. \n\nAnd now the law prevents the gift cards to expire and loose its values 100% but why NY Waterway tix can be expired and loose its value at 100%??? I have a subway card that expires on me once a while, however, once I replace with a new card, the balance is transferred to the newly issue card. Never had an single issue to use it at all.\n\nNow I choose NOT to ride the ferry whenever possible or if I must, I only buy one tix at a time. I encourage you to do the same until they change their policy. It\u2019s very expense to ride the ferry, $9 each way, $18 round trip. Uber is only few dollars more from westside highway to Port Imperial. if you buy 10 tix and have one or two tix expire on you, besides kills the 7% deal you get, you can get embarrassed in front of everyone and lose 10 to 30 mins of your time.

We arrived early & received a free gift each & were shown to our seats, which were far more roomy & comfortable than any we've experienced at grounds back home. There was a great choice of reasonably priced food & drink available, a good sized gift shop & plenty of clean toilets. MCU is quite small, which means a great view of the pitch from anywhere in the stadium. There was lots of entertainment & plenty of crowd involvement, making it a really family friendly experience.

Extremely interactive fun, great exhibits, very knowledgeable, friendly staff."},{"review":"Our family of 4 visited this museum twice within our 5 day stay in NYC. In fact, this was one of the main draws of NYC for our 13 year old, math and science lover son. Our 6 year old daughter loved it too. I cannot say what the experience with be like for non-math lovers, but I can say that we could just not get enough of this place...all of us. I think that this would not be ideal for a kid who is more into passive activities or who is not interested at least a bit in math or science. This is a very interactive and do it yourself kind of museum, such that if you like your learning handed to you, you won't love it. That being said, the staff at this place are amazing...they make sure you are getting something out of it and that you know the objective of every activity. This would also not really work for really young kids - like under 5 yrs old - unless they are inclined to this kind of thing. The ideas\/concepts are not at all simple and it is really geared toward the math inclined but what an amazing place! We spent about 6 hours total at MOMATH and could have spent more. Clean, modern, new and across the street from a great park...take a break and grab some shake shack while at MOMATH."},{"review":"As a maths teacher I really wanted to visit the museum, I wasn't disappointed. There were lots of different activities for children and adults. It was the summer holidays, so quite busy but I could always find an activity to look at. The staff were helpful but it would have helped if there had been more detailed practical instructions at some of the exhibits - how to work them etc. the maths instructions were good - with 3 levels of maths facts given. The \"cafe\" was good, a place to sit down and rest your legs whilst trying some puzzles. But NO refreshments!"},{"review":"We picked this place because it is a block from the hotel we stayed. I thought it wouldn't hurt if my kids didn't like it because we had free admissions. Once I entered, I was glad to go there. The place is very small but very unique. Most of the hand on\/interactive games I hadn't seen before and very interesting. We spent couple hours and didn't want to leave. I and my husband had fun at the puzzle section and watching my kids playing the robotic worms. It is not crowded when we were there. If we didn't have plan that night, we would stay longer."},{"review":"I love how this museum celebrates mathematics and intellectual curiosity! It is better for children and can be a little boring for adults, although I found the information for each exhibit to be at a level suitable for older children or adults. This museum is great for serious math nerds and the casual visitor alike!"},{"review":"My husband actually googled up this museum by accident and we visited it only because the Statue of Liberty (which was on my daughter's list) had too long of a line. At first my daughter was very displeased to hear where we were heading too. However, it turned out to be much more fun than the Statue. From educational point of view, this is an awesome place. It has activities for developing a multitude of skills such as geometrical, logical, and even experimental design. Needless to say, that kids absolutely love it. As funny as it may sound, due to some reason, my daughter seemed to be the only girl in there."},{"review":"this museum is partly math partly physics. the first floor has very stimulating hands on interactive exhibits with kiosks designed to explain the math behind the exhibit. a lot of fun and informative.the second floor exhibits did not all work and had less explanation overall.still a great place for learning, up to age 12\/ pre-teen. doubt a teenager would love it but some might if they like physics demonstrations."},{"review":"My kids loved this place. It is all interactive! They have many activities for the kids to try and they are experiencing math without even noticing. My 7 and 10 yr olds both enjoyed creating different shapes, took a stroll on a bicycle with square and triangle wheels and got to interact with many different exhibits that helped them understand why math is important. it is also not very full so the kids don't have to wait do the activities which was a great plus."},{"review":"Amazing museum with hands on games and exhibits that show the practical applications of math, even complex math. My son is a math lover, so I went for his sake, but I ended up loving it, too! Employees were terrific--enthusiastic, helpful, and knowledgeable. Excellent gift shop with interesting and unique puzzles, games, etc"},{"review":"If you have a child who loves all things math-related, this is the place to be! My almost 10 year old son was actively engaged here for a solid four hours. It wasn't busy when we went and that was a huge bonus as he didn't have to wait for any of the interactive exhibits (and they're all interactive) and the staff really engaged with him a number of times throughout our visit. A few exhibits were out of order, but that really didn't impact us in any way. The exhibits are almost all very unique and appeal to a wide variety of ages. There is something here for everyone and for those willing to take the time to learn something new, that opportunity is afforded you at every exhibit. I consider myself a non-math person and the first yawn didn't come out of my mouth until we were nearly ready to go. There is no place to eat here, no water fountains, clean bathrooms, stroller friendly and a very awesome gift shop. I'd love to see them expand this wonderful gift shop - more math stuff = better. The admission rates are fair, especially for expensive-everything-NYC and there is a nice park across the street - trees, a playground, paths. (Madison Square Park.)

By the way, we just missed seeing Mr. Trump who had been here earlier in the day with an entourage of secret service agents."},{"review":"From floor to ceiling this building is beautiful from the waterfall, to the shops, to the roof top public gardens."},{"review":"Gleaming tower that's a testament to Trump - from the entry everything's about HIM HIM HIM, his books, clothes etc.\n\nThe decor is pretty nice - marble walls with a gushing water feature. Take a trip down to the toilets then up to one of the rooftop gardens to see a \"no-expense-spared\" approach to design.\n\nDuring our visit there was a choir playing downstairs - the tall ceilings lend themselves to great acoustics."},{"review":"Visited this place several times and it's not as impressive as many other buildings in New York there are few eating stops there and when you go out through the back you will find Nike world and another outside area . It's a quick visit when walking past place ."},{"review":"We were in the area and decided to stop in for a look. I wanted to buy my dad a Trump t-shirt, but they only offer up to size L. We went to the ice cream shop to cool off and enjoy a treat, but the one person working in the ice cream shop was completely overwhelmed by a crowd of foreign teenage girls that all too happily cut to the front of the line. Not the staff's fault of course, but needless to say, we left without any ice cream or a shirt.\n\nIf you happen to be walking by, it's a nice place to stop for a few minutes, but I wouldn't make it a destination unless you just happen to be a big fan of Donald Trump."},{"review":"The great advantage is that it is one of the few building at the top of Fifth that you can visit and be in the dry. Well worth a walk through and there are shops and restaurants you can visit. Not somewhere to make a point of travelling to but if you are in the area (and most visitors tramp along Fifth Avenue at some stage) then well worth a visit"},{"review":"Improve on the original? It is impressive especially with the clouds reflecting on it's windows. And the 911 Memorial at it's feet."},{"review":"I walked by this place on my full day in NY but saw a doorman there and thought I couldn't go in. The next day I was walking by it again in a heavy downpour and saw people going inside. So I decided to check it out.\n\nOn the ground floor are two \"Donald Trump\" souvenir stands and an escalator which leads to a Starbucks. As I was riding the escalator I looked down and saw a large foyer with a restaurant attached to it.\n\nI had already eaten breakfast but decided to see what was down there. Yes, there is a restaurant and you can walk into a nice enclosed glass atrium to relax or get dry from the rain. In this foyer I saw the entrance to Niketown.\n\nI looked over the souvenir stands and saw one was for men and one for women. Course they are all Donald Trump items ranging from polos to mugs, and naturally a full size umbrella.\n\nThe only thing that impressed me was the foyer as it gives a great view of 5th Ave and you can sit and unwind. I cannot rate the restaurant since I did not eat there.\n\nOther than that there really isn't too much to it."},{"review":"Well, I met The Donald. The staff are very protective of anyone who lives there and of course you can't just walk in and go up, not even for my employer. I had to get \"checked\" in. I can say it was the most elegant, dark, but elegant place I have worked in. They need more lighting in the building."},{"review":"The Trump building is in the vicinity of many a illustrious pieces of real estate. So, though impressive, it pales in comparison both in historical significance as well as symbol of power.\n\nBut it is a beautiful as well as impressive piece of work. I am sure the NYSE, Wall Street, the Bull of the wall Street etc will hold your attention more."}]},{"nearBy":["FAO Schwarz","Bergdorf Goodman","Fifth Avenue Thai Spa"]}]},{"UnionSquareTheatre.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"100 East 17th Street","postalCode":"10003","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212 505 0700"},{"reviews":[{"review":"We saw the play \"39 Steps.\" It was based on the Alfred Hitchcock film about a man who was on the run for a crime he did not commit and he finds love along the way, set in 1935. There were four actors who played multiple roles. The play was enjoyable and I giggled often at the staged antics. At the performance that we saw the role of Richard Hannay normally played by ROBERT PETKOFF was played by DANIEL HARRAY. There was one intermission. The theater was small and intimate and was not in the best condition."},{"review":"A truly old throwback to the early theatre scene in NYC, this worn theatre offers a delightful venue for the play, \"39 Steps\". Located amongst the beautifully sculpted architecture of early majestic tall buildings and across from the \"W\" hotel, this theatre is near the iconic Union Square Park. The play, \"39 Steps\" is set in London and is a wonderful farce of a mystery thriller ala Hitchcock. The cast of 4 provides a whirlwind set of many characters drawing applause and laughter for the speed in which they can reappear in opposing roles. A fun night of entertainment at a very reasonable price for NYC playgoers."},{"review":"The theatre itself was old and worn and at first sight is not very appealing as the box office is a peep hole in a small lobby. The interior where the seats are was comfortable and everyone has a good view of the stage as the theatre is \" cosy\". Staff were pleasant and the show started on time. Despite the lack of ambiance the show was excellent. The cast were amazingly funny and we thoroughly enjoyed the performance and would recommend the show to everyone, especially Hitchcock buffs like myself.I was pleasantly surprised how entertained I was. The multiple roles that each of the 4 cast members were playing just added to the hilarity. Nearby is union square so if you wanted a good meal and a place to drink then it is literally a short walk to the end of the street and viola you are in the square. During the week most places close early so eat before you go to an evening performance as 10pm seems to be closing time.The theatre has obviously been there for a while, so if you like a historic facade, then you will be fine. The acoustics are good also and you do get that feeling of inclusion due to it's small size, so any seat is really a good seat!"},{"review":"What fun. And the teenagers laughed their heads off! Great shtick masterfully timed\nand nuanced; every cheek flutter and raised eyebrow. Eventually this could rival\nThe Mouse Trap for longest run; everyone should see it. Especially those who want\nto particpate in theater in any way."},{"review":"Went to see 39 Steps (wonderful comedy) and it fit perfect in this small, intimate theater. Building is older and could use a little sprucing up, but views of the stage were great and the support staff did their jobs well."},{"review":"The 39 Steps is definitely a find. The theatre is downtown, away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square and is not as elaborate as many Broadway theaters, but solidly constructed with excellent acoustics and moderately comfortable seats. \n\n But the professional performance by just 4 actors playing over 100 roles in a fast-paced and cleverly staged take-off of Hitchcock's movie is most entertaining and meets the top standards of NY theatre. It was fun and extremely enjoyable, as well as priced right- at $39 for any mezzanine seat. Being a small off-Broadway theatre, there was not a bad seat in the house. My family consists of tough critics, and we all came out of the theatre laughing and very satisfied."},{"review":"We saw 39 Steps here. Play was not the best of this kind that we've seen (and enjoy). Seats in this historic space were quite uncomfortable."},{"review":"As a theater, the Union Square Theater is very dated. I've been to many more modern and comfortable theaters in NYC. However, the staff was extremely polite and helpful. 39 Steps was very funny and creative. A decent way to spend a few hours in NYC. I recommend finding discounts for this show on Groupon."},{"review":"If you can get a discount ticket then you should go. The two singers sounded very much like Lennon and McCartney. However the theater leaves a lot to be desired. DO NOT sit in the first few rows or you will need a chiropractor to fix your neck and back when you leave."},{"review":"Entertaining and at times spellbinding play about John Lennon, Looking Through a Glass Onion. Great to hear those songs again, John Waters was great.\nTheater itself is a good venue, we sat Row M center and except for a bit of a problem with my seat (bottom of the seat sloped a bit downward) it was all good. Would definitely return there for a future show."}]},{"nearBy":["Union Square","Union Square Greenmarket","American Ballet Theatre"]}]},{"ImperialTheatre.html":[{"address":{"streetAddress":"249 West 45th Street","postalCode":"10036-3902","addressLocality":"New York City","addressRegion":"NY"}},{"Phone Number":" 212-239-6200"},{"reviews":[{"review":"NO REVIEW"},{"review":"Just watched the 1:30pm Les Miserables today with my mom. Superb performance by the cast and I twice shed tears when I heard the songs that are so familiar and dear to me, Empty Chairs and Empty Tables being one. This is the second time I watched the show, because once is just not enough. Unfortunately at the end, instead of filling my head with the wonderful memories of the show on our way out, we were swatted away by an usher like flies. I was trying to turn my cellphone back on to take a picture of the stage, in that three minutes of time, he kept pushing us out with very rude comments. I regret not able to summon the words in these three minutes to return his assault. It was only three minutes, felt even longer because of the vexation he put me through. I wanted to take pictures of the stage because I love the show. I get it, it is his job. But I also pity him, for he is privileged to watch the show and listen to the singings at work, but too numb and cold to appreciate it and scolds others who do. \n\nI am sure my comments are going to get lost in the sea of comments and no actions will come from management even if they see it by chance. However, I truly hope that someone who cares about the production and customer satisfaction takes this seriously because the wonderful performance of the cast shouldn't be overshadowed by the offensive manners of an usher."},{"review":"When I spend 150 dollars to see such a fantastic show as les mis I expect to get a first class New York experience. Ohhh how wrong was I. Firstly. The pre show drinks. Be prepared to pay $5 extra for a cup on top of the drink price. But don't worry folks. You don't pay again for the cup when you top during the interval. Only for the drink. Ohhh hang on a min. That's difficult. I queued for the toilet (sorry restroom) for nearly 10 mins. Yep. Just one carzy for men and one for the ladies. Joke. So I then queue for a re fill in my expensive cup. Well. As I got to the front of the line (queue to us Brits) the gentleman literally pushed me out of the way with a big curtain as he closed the bar. No sorry. No excuse me. Just a very curt \"well you had 15 mins to get a drink. The show must go on\". WHAT? Really. Dear imperial theatre. If you insist on charging the prices you do then please provide toilets (restrooms) and adequate facilities for people to purchase refreshments. Oh yea. And fire your staff and get people that understand how to deliver customer service that befits your country. Thank you. Ps the show was brilliant but ruined by your service."},{"review":"I wasn't expecting this production of 'Les Mis' to be as spectacular as it was, but wow!

It was our first time on Broadway to watch a show and our seats were fantastic in the 3rd row. The visual effects and sound were first class and the actors performed a show that we will always remember. all in all a delightful place for a wonderful show."},{"review":"This was my first Broadway show (on Broadway) and I loved it. The theater was nice, but the food and drinks (snacks) were very over priced. I paid $4 for a bottle of water. The ushers were very rude. The expected everyone to understand that they were supposed to wait to be seated (I understand people often seat themselves incorrectly). When someone walked past them (obviously in most cases, not realizing the \"rules\"), they would rudely yell, \"Please wait!\". Ok, they used the word please, but it still came off very rude. Lucky for me, I hadn't tried seating myself.\n\nThe show itself was amazing. Clear sound and from my 15th row seat, great view."},{"review":"Imperial is a truly beautiful theatre. Once you stop and think about all the shows that have been housed here and all of the performers who have graced this stage it stirs the imagination. Les Mis has a ftting home."},{"review":"It's a beautiful place with great seating, sound and lighting, just be wary of the far left and right rear seating areas in orchestra due to some of the light and sound workers there. It is kept up very nicely and the architecture is great!"},{"review":"We seem to be addicted. We've been to New York City four times in the last nine months, and seen a total of ten shows, four of which were Les Miserables. We've seen Jean Valjean played by Ramin Karimloo, Alfie Boe, and Aaron Walpole. Should you arrive at the theater and find that a lead is being sung by an understudy, don't let that spoil your evening. They are selected for their vocal and acting ability, and they live up to their roles.\nWe always sit in the Mezzanine, because we like to see the entire stage at once. This production is stirring and effective. At times, there is so much going on that you must look everywhere at once. Accoustics are excellent, in my opinion. I'd also like to add that we purchase our tickets through TodayTix, an app for a smartphone, and we have yet to be disappointed. As we live in Maine, we can't count on rush tickets or the TKTS booth in Times Square. TodayTix allows a purchase up to a week ahead, and while you cannot choose your seats, we have been satisfied. This performance, we sat in the front row of the rear mezzanine and were not disappointed. If the view concerns you, do what we do and bring binoculars!"},{"review":"We saw Alfie Boe as Jean Val Jean in Les Miserables and loved both the play and the venue. My only complaint would be the lack of knee room, a snug fit if you're tall. The staff is organized, informed and friendly, and definitely adhere to the seating policies for latecomers. Comfy seats too. Les Miz for us is a must-see, but I'd go to another musical here as well.
