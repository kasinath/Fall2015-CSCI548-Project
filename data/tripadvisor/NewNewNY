He had on earphones and was singing gospel music. The minute the line started moving, he pretended his date hadn't showed up and left the line. I really think he was waiting for me to let down my guard. I put on my earphones and ignored him so it was clear he wasn't with me. Be careful!"

I am sure it was originally designed for shorter people years ago, but if it were not for the fantastic play, it would have been difficult to last thru two hours+."

We were told in a very unhelpful manner that we needed to leave the theater and print the tickets out. We tried reasoning with the employee by saying that it was obvious that we had paid (summarily) for these tickets. While that was obvious to him, he still (taking pleasure in his position of power) made us run to the Marriott to have them printed. Fortunately, the concierge at the Marriott was accostomed to helping patrons of the RRT because it happens several times a day. So, instead of helping HIS paying customers he helped customers of another business (RRT) print their tickets. We made it back to the theater with one minute to spare and no one ever scanned or collected them. I don't understand why the employee at will call HAD to have a printed copy. What a shame that anything should detract fom the incredible, unbelievable performance that happens when Hamilton begins."

No leg room. Thankfully, the couple on the aisle offered to trade seats. New York at its finest. Thank you!"

Still they put on the best productions you would want to see and Hamilton is no exception. Now playing at the Richard Rodgers theater.\n\nIt is not often that I get to see a new musical on Broadway but this time I got the original cast! I had purchased my ticket 3 months prior to my visit and had a seat on the left side of the first balcony. I had a great view of the stage along with the turntable used I would imagine to mark the passing of time or events.\n\nWritten and starring Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton the show is completely sung in rap music so you need to listen carefully to the lyrics in order to follow the story line.\n\nLeslie Odom Jr stars as Aaron Burr who keeps reminding Hamilton that all his \"talking\" will eventually lead to trouble. The story follows the life of Hamilton from the Revolutionary war, the aftermath, and what eventually led to his famous duel with Aaron Burr.\n\nI loved watching the \"Schuyler sisters\" number. They seemed reminiscent of the 3 daughters of Tevye in Fiddler on the Roof.\n\nJonathan Groff provides standout comic relief as King George with the audience singing to his da da da da medley.\n\nCourse one of my favorite actors was Daveed Diggs in two different roles. First, he played Lafayette and later Thomas Jefferson. He had me going in stitches.\n\nThere is much action going on throughout the show with minor characters so like a circus it is hard to see everyone at the same time but the spotlight always stays on the principal characters doing the singing.\n\nI had to get the original cast cd since it contains the libretto to the story. The turntable really adds to the production since they can shift characters around easily.\n\nPlease note that Hamilton the musical contains explicit content which may not be appropriate for all audiences. \n\nThe cast joins as a whole for the curtain call as opposed to bringing them out individually leading to the starring role. I found that very unique.\n\nAll in all I was thrilled at the opportunity to see it and have a great time to HAM it up!"

Row A is perfect. Although I heard complaints of no space for legs in the upper parts of the theatre, in Row A there is a curtain below the seats where you can stretch out your legs. Even though we were high, we could see and hear everything. Lovely venue."

You can feel the greed imagining how they squeezed in as many seats as possible with little regard for comfort. The decor of the theatre is cheesy and dated and the sound system is mediocre. The layout on line is very misleading too, you can not see anything form the upper mezz."
